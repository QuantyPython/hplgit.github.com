<h1 id="___sec0">Comparison of my two books on Python programming </h1>

<p>
I have written two books on Python programming:

<img src="fig/TCSE6_pic.jpg" width=160 style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;">
<img src="fig/TCSE3_pic.jpg" width=160 style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;">
<br>

<p>
Since the titles are similar, people often ask me what the differences
between these books are.  <em>Python Scripting for Computational Science</em>
was written for researchers and students having traditional
programming experience with specialized science codes in Fortran, C,
or C++.  The book explains primarily how Python can be used to
efficiently automate the many administrative tasks encountered by
computational scientist (preparing data files, running experiments,
gluing programs, managing files and directories, communicating through
network, equipping programs with command-line or graphical user
interfaces, etc.). Administrative programs also often need to do some
data analysis and numerical computations so NumPy/SciPy and coupling
of Python with Fortran, C, and C++ are also important topics in this
book.

<p>
<em>A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python</em> was written for
teaching beginning students how to program computers, with emphasis on
using the computer to solve mathematical problems from applied
science. We use Python because this allows a continuous transition
from Matlab-style &quot;flat&quot; programs to Java/C++-style object-oriented
programs. The book does not cover administrative tasks with processes,
files, user interfaces, etc., but focuses solely on numerical
computing using examples from calculus, physics, biology, and
finance. The goal is to teach a beginner the most important
constructions in a programming language, how to think about
programming, and how to use programming in combination with numerical
methods as a powerful tool to attack mathematical problems.

<p>
The book emphasizes the use of a subset of Python and an additional
package SciTools so that the transition to Matlab, which is widely
used in later science courses, is as easy and smooth as possible (a
key feature to get accept for using Python as the first language in
science programs).  In particular, we have an interface to
visualization which is very close to Matlab with respect to syntax and
functionality, but several alternative visualization packages
(including Matlab, Matplotlib, Gnuplot, and Vtk) can be used as
backend.

<p>
I have extensive experience with using both books in large courses
at the University of Oslo. Although the <em>Primer</em> book is intended for
beginners, it has become popular among professionals too, especially for
seeing how Python is a good alternative to Matlab.
