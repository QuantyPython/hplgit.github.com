I enjoy a shared position between Simula Research Laboratory and
the University of Oslo, working 100% as a "Simula Fellow":
"http://www.simula.no/people/hpl" and being on 80% leave from my
university "professorship":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/hpl/index.html" at the
"Department of Informatics": "http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/".
At Simula, I manage the "Center for
Biomedical Computing": "http://cbc.simula.no/pub/", a Norwegian Center
of Excellence 2007-2017. My research there is now mostly focused on
cerebrospinal fluid flow in the brain and spine as well as methods for
uncertainty quantification. At the University, I am involved in the
newly established "Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity":
"http://www.cinpla.org/" and in reforming science education through
the world-leading "Computing in Science Education":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" project.  A
significant amount of my time is spent on being the Editor-in-Chief of
"SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing":
"http://www.siam.org/journals/sisc.php".

__Past activity.__ Before taking up the professorship at the
Department of Informatics in 1999, I worked as an Associate Professor
and later as a full Professor of Mechanics at the "Department of
Mathematics":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/research/groups/mechanics/",
University of Oslo.  I have worked part-time at the "Department of
Scientific Computing, Uppsala University": "http://www.tdb.uu.se"
(1999-2002); "SINTEF Applied Mathematics": "http://www.sintef.no/math"
(1991-1997); "Physics of Geological Processes":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/pgp/"
(2003-3007), a Norwegian Center of Excellence; and Numerical Objects (1997-2003), a company that commercialized the
"Diffpack": "http://www.diffpack.com" software, which I spent much
time on developing in the 1990s. My formal education is from the
University of Oslo, with MSc and PhD degrees in Mechanics. My "CV":
"cv.pdf" has more details.
