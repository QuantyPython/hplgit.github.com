Motivation
==========

Greg Wilson's excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`__ provides a detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems. Here follows a shorter motivation
and a quick overview of the basic concepts.

Why not Dropbox or Google Drive?
--------------------------------

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`__ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`__.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them and when the different versions are not annotated with
sensible comments. Another deficiency of Dropbox and Google Drive is
that they sync all your files in a folder, a feature you clearly do not
want if there are many large files (simulation data, visualizations,
movies, binaries from compilations,
temporary scratch files, automatically generated copies)
that can easily be regenerated.

However, the most serious problem with Dropbox and Google Drive arises
when several people edit files simultaneously: it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools, which means a *true version control system*.
The following text aims at providing you with the minimum information
to started with Git, the leading version control system, combined
with project hosting services for file storage.

Repositories and local copies
-----------------------------

The mentioned services host all your files in a specific project in what
is known as a *repository*, or *repo* for short.  When a copy of the
files are wanted on a certain computer, one clones the repository on
that computer.  This creates a local copy of the files. Now files can
be edited, new ones can be added, and files can be deleted.  These
changes are then brought back to the repository.  If users at
different computers synchronize their files frequently with the
repository, most modern version control systems will be able to merge
changes in files that have been edited simultaneously on different
computers. This is perhaps one of the most useful features of project
hosting services. However, the merge functionality clearly works best
for pure text files and less well for binary files, such as PDF files,
MS Word or Excel documents, and OpenOffice documents.

Installing Git
--------------

.. index:: git

The installation of Git on various systems is described
on the `Git website <http://git-scm.com/>`__ under the *Download* section.
Git involves compiled code so it is most convenient to download a
precompiled binary version of the software on Windows, Mac and other
Linux computers.
On Ubuntu or any Debian-based system the relevant installation command is

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> sudo apt-get install git gitk git-doc

This tutorial explains Git interaction through command-line applications
in a terminal window. There are numerous `graphical user interfaces to
Git <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Graphical_Interfaces>`__. Three examples are
`git-cola <http://git-cola.github.com/downloads.html>`__,
`TortoiseGit <https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/>`__, and
`SourceTree <http://sourcetreeapp.com/>`__.

Make a file ``.gitconfig`` in your home directory with information on
your full name, email address, your favorite text editor, and
the name of an "excludes file" which defines the file types that Git
should omit when bringing new directories under version control.
Here is a simplified version of the author's ``.gitconfig`` file:

.. code-block:: text

        [user]
        name = Hans Petter Langtangen
        email = hpl@simula.no
        editor = emacs
        
        [core]
        excludesfile = ~/.gitignore

The "excludes file" is called ``.gitignore`` and must list,
using the Unix Shell Wildcard notation,
the type of files that you do not need to have under version control,
because they represent garbage or temporary information,
or they can easily be regenerated from
some other source files. A suggested `.gitignore <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/bitgit/src-bitgit/.gitignore>`__ file looks like

.. code-block:: text

        # compiled files:
        *.o
        *.so
        *.a
        # temporary files:
        *.bak
        *.swp
        *~
        .*~
        *.old
        tmp*
        temp*
        .#*
        \#*
        # tex files:
        *.log
        *.dvi
        *.aux
        *.blg
        *.idx
        *.nav
        *.out
        *.toc
        *.snm
        *.vrb
        # eclipse files:
        *.cproject
        *.project
        # misc:
        .DS_Store

Be critical to what kind of files you really need a full history of.
For example, you do not want to populate the repository with
big graphics files of the type that can easily be regenerated by
some program.
