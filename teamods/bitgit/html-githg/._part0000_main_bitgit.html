<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. Especially when working
with software development or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson&#8217;s excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.</p>
<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &#8220;in the
cloud&#8221; and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work &#8211; and all other important files.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-not-dropbox-or-google-drive">
<h2>Why not Dropbox or Google Drive?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-dropbox-or-google-drive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The simplest services for hosting project files are <a class="reference external" href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them and when different versions are not annotated with
sensible comments.</p>
<p>More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.</p>
<div class="admonition-essence admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Essence</p>
<p class="last">The essence with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the &#8220;master version&#8221; at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.</p>

<div class="section" id="project-hosting-services">
<h2>Project hosting services<a class="headerlink" href="#project-hosting-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Four popular project hosting services are</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bigbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bitbucket.org</span></tt></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">github.com</span></tt></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com">Googlecode</a> at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">code.google.com</span></tt></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">launchpad.net</span></tt></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sourceforge.net</span></tt></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="repositories-and-local-copies">
<h2>Repositories and local copies<a class="headerlink" href="#repositories-and-local-copies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The mentioned services host all your files in a specific project in what
is known as a <em>repository</em>, or <em>repo</em> for short.  When a copy of the
files are wanted on a certain computer, one clones the repository on
that computer.  This creates a local copy of the files. Now files can
be edited, new ones can be added, and files can be deleted.  These
changes are then brought back to the repository.  If users at
different computers synchronize their files frequently with the
repository, most modern version control systems will be able to merge
changes in files that have been edited simultaneously on different
computers. This is perhaps one of the most useful features of project
hosting services. However, the merge functionality clearly works best
for pure text files and less well for binary files, such as PDF files,
MS Word or Excel documents, and OpenOffice documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-choose">
<h2>What to choose?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-choose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It might seem challenging to pick the project hosting service
and the version control system that are right for you. Below
is some very personal advice.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>I would recommend Git as the default choice of version control system.</li>
<li>If you need private repos and you are not a student, choose
Bitbucket unless you are willing to pay for private repos at GitHub.</li>
<li>If you want to make links to your programs in documentation,
stay away from Bitbucket as this site embeds the version of the
file into its URL (but you can get around this problem with a trick
described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="main_bitgit.html#bitgit-bitbucket-urls"><em>Linking to Bitbucket files</em></a>).</li>
<li>If you want to easily drop HTML files for documentation around in
your repo, Googlecode will display them as web pages right away,
while the procedure on GitHub is technically more complicated
(Bitbucket does not yet support web pages as part of a project).
Unfortunately, Googlecode does not allow MathJax for rendering
LaTeX mathematics in HTML files.</li>
<li>If a few collaborate on a project and everyone wants to be notified
in email about changes in project files, Bitbucket and Googlecode have
better support for this feature than GitHub.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For the examples below, assume that you have some directory tree
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my-project</span></tt> with files that you want to host at Bitbucket, GitHub, or
Googlecode and bring under version control. The official name of the
project is &#8220;My Project&#8221;.</p>
