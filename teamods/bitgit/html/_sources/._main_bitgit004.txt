GitHub
======

.. index:: GitHub

Go to ``github.com`` and create an account. Then go to your account
settings (icon in the upper left corner of the page),
choose *SSH Keys*, and provide your SSH key
unless you have already registered this key with another GitHub
account (see Appendix :ref:`appendix:github:multiple:accounts`).
Often, it is just a
matter of pasting the contents of ``id_rsa.pub`` or ``id_dsa.pub`` files,
located in the
``.ssh`` subdirectory of your home directory, into the *Key* box in the
web page. Make sure to just cut and paste the text from, e.g., ``id_rsa.pub``
without any extra whitespaces or other text. How to generate these
files is described in the link *generating SSH keys* above the SSH Keys
box (or see the introduction to Bitbucket above).

If the account is a project account and not a personal account,
I do not recommend to provide an SSH key although it can be
done (see Appendix :ref:`appendix:github:multiple:accounts`). It is easier
to log in and add collaborators using their personal GitHub usernames.

Creating a new project  (3)
---------------------------

Click on *New repository* on the main page and fill out a project
name, here *My Project*, click the check button *Initialize this
repository with a README*, and click on *Create repository*.
Unless you pay, all repos are public, but students and teachers
can request `free, private repos <https://github.com/edu>`__.

The next step is to clone the project on your personal computer. Click
on the *SSH* button to see the address of the project, and
paste this address into a terminal window, after ``git clone``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git clone git://github.com:user/My-Project.git

Make sure you substitute ``user`` by your own username on GitHub.

The result of the ``git clone`` command is a new directory ``My-Project``.
It contains the file ``.git``, which shows that it is a Git repository.
It also contains a default ``README.md`` file with the project name and
description. The extension ``.md`` signifies a file written in the
`Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__ format.
You may use the `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__ format as an alternative
(``README.rst``), or simply write a plain text file (``README``),
but the ``git mv`` command must be used to change the filename.

You can now add files and directories into the ``My-Project`` directory.
When your initial file collection has the desired form, you must
run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git add .
        Terminal> git commit -am 'First set of files.'
        Terminal> git push -u origin master

The daily file operations are explained in the section :ref:`bitgit:git`.

Collaborating  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To give others permissions to push their edits of files to the
repository, you click on the *Settings* link in the right sidebar,
then click on *Collaborators* on the left, and fill in the name
of a collaborator (her or his username on GitHub).
Many find it convenient to be notified in email when others have
pushed a new version of the files to the repo. Click on *Service Hooks*
in the project's *Settings* menu, choose *Email*, fill in
at most two whitespace-separated email addresses, mark the
*Send from Author* and *Active* boxes, and click on *Update Settings*.
More addresses must be dealt with through a `mailing list <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7015300/receiving-emails-on-git-push>`__
and filling in the name of that list.

Anyone who participates in a project (has write access) or watches a
project (having clicked the *watch* button) can monitor the
development of the activity on their GitHub main page. Go to *Account Settings*
and choose *Notification Center*.  There you see two sections,
*Participating* and *Watching*, for those participating in the project
(granted write access) and those watching the project (having clicked
the *watch* button), respectively.

.. No, this doesn't work: Clicking the *Email* button turns

.. on email notifications to those participating and/or watching.

Wiki pages  (2)
---------------

With every GitHub project there is an option to create wiki pages.
Click on the *Wiki* button in the right sidebar on the main page of
the project. Click on *New Page* to create a new page. The wiki pages
can be written in different markup languages. Markdown is the default
choice, but you can alternatively use MediaWiki and
reStructuredText. Unfortunately, *GitHub wiki pages do not allow LaTeX
mathematics through MathJax*, even though MediaWiki has support for
LaTeX (the reason is `security issues <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16889421/how-to-insert-javascript-to-enable-mathjax-on-github-wiki-pages>`__).

The wiki pages can be written and maintained through the web browser
interface, but it is usually more convenient to clone them on
your computer as this makes it easy to add figures and other documents
you may want to link to. It also makes it straightforward to edit
the wiki text in your favorite text editor. The wiki pages are
stored in a separate repo and can be cloned by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git clone git://github.com/user/My-Project.wiki.git

This command makes a local copy of the pages in the directory
``My-Project.wiki``, which you may prefer to have at the same level
as the project directory itself in your directory tree.

Each wiki page has its own file, where the extension reflects
the markup language used, e.g., ``.md`` for Markdown, ``.rest`` for
reStructuredText, ``.mediawiki`` for MediaWiki,
and ``.creole`` for Creole wiki. The wiki files are handled as other files in a
GitHub project, i.e., you need to pull before editing and then
perform commit and push. After the push you can reload the page
in the web browser to monitor the effect.

You may consider having the original text in ``doconce`` format and
generate the wiki in the reStructuredText or MediaWiki format.

Do changes, commit the usual way, and push by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git push git@github.com:user/My-project.wiki.git

The address can be stored as ``url`` in ``.git/config`` in the
root directory of the wiki project so that just a
``git push`` works.

Project web pages
-----------------

HTML pages stored in your repo cannot be linked to and properly
rendered as web pages.
Links to HTML files at GitHub will be either rendered as nicely typeset
HTML code or as plain text.

.. index:: git checkout

.. index:: gh-pages on GitHub

Quite often you want to create a set of HTML pages to document your
project. This can be done as part of your repo, but you must apply
a special technique consisting in creating a separate *gh-pages*
branch in Git and making the HTML files in this particular branch.
The recipe is described in detail below.

1. Go to the  project page on ``github.com`` and click *Settings*.

2. Click on *Automatic Page Generator* under the *GitHub Pages*.

3. Proceed clicking *Continue to Layouts*, choose
   a design of the ``index.html`` page that GitHub will
   create for you, and click *Publish*.

4. Go to the root directory of the project, ``My-Project``
   and run ``git fetch origin``.

5. Run ``git checkout gh-pages``.

You have now a *new branch* called gh-pages of your project
containing an ``index.html`` file and directories for JavaScript
programs and CSS style sheets in the root directory. The gh-pages
branch will also all files *not* contained in the *master branch*,
typically redundant files you have generated and which should not be
stored in the version control system (remove these manually with ``git
rm``).  You can populate the root directory and subdirectories of your
gh-pages branch with HTML and other files as you like. The key issue
is that the people out there will only see the web pages that
correspond to your HTML files in the gh-pages branch!

The ``index.html`` page is invoked by the web address

.. code-block:: text

        http://user.github.io/My-Project/index.html

where ``user`` is the GitHub
username and ``My-Project`` is the project name.

.. Update this info when I have maintained gh-pages for a while!

.. Could also have a special section on branching in git (above,

.. then the info here is simple... YES!).

The web pages and project files are now in two different branches.
To see the branches, type ``git branch`` and the one you are in will
be marked with ``*`` in the output. Switching to the master branch
is done by ``git checkout master``. Similarly, ``git checkout gh-pages``
switches to the gh-pages branch.

My personal preference is to have the master and gh-pages
synchronized, at least in projects where I want to link to various
source code files or other files from the web documentation.
Sometimes I also update files in the gh-pages branch without
remembering to switch to the master branch.  To this end, one needs
to *merge* the branches, i.e., automatically edit files
in the current branch such that they are up-to-date and
identical to files in another branch.

.. index:: git merge

.. index:: git pull

.. index:: git commit

.. index:: git push

To merge the current branch with some branch named ``otherbranch``, run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git merge otherbranch

Git applies smart algorithms that very often manage to merge the
files without human interaction. However, occasionally these algorithms
are not able to resolve conflicts between two files.
A message about the failure of the merge is seen in the terminal
window, and the corresponding files have markers in them showing
which sections that needs manual editing to resolve the conflicts.
Run
``git diff`` to show the problems (you can tailor this command to your
needs as explained in the section :ref:`bitgit:git:fetch`). After a manual
edit, do ``git commit -a``. More details on merging appears
in the section :ref:`bitgit:git:merge`.

If you want to keep the master branch and the gh-pages branch
synchronized,
start with merging the gh-pages branch with the master
branch and push the complete file collection to the gh-pages branch.
Then switch to the master
branch and merge with gh-pages so you get the autogenerated
``index.html`` file and associated files and directories for web pages
in the root directory of the master branch as well:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git merge master
        Terminal> touch .nojekyll
        Terminal> git push origin gh-pages
        Terminal> git checkout master
        Terminal> git merge gh-pages

You *must* add an empty file ``.nojekyll`` in the top
directory of the project pages if you want to use Sphinx-generated
HTML pages (or other pages using javascripts, style sheets, and images
in subdirectories whose names start with an underscore).

You can now add the documentation to the project files and
maintain them in the master branch.
Before publishing documents online,
make sure to update the gh-pages branch by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git commit -am 'Ensure commit of master branch'
        Terminal> git push origin master
        Terminal> git checkout gh-pages
        Terminal> git pull origin gh-pages
        Terminal> git merge master
        Terminal> git push origin gh-pages
        Terminal> git checkout master

Personally, I like to move the generated ``index.html`` file and all
associated scripts, stylesheets, and images from the root directory to
some more isolated place, say ``doc/web``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> git mv index.html params.json stylesheets/ images/ \
                         javascripts/ doc/web/

The URL of the ``index.html`` file is

.. code-block:: text

        http://user.github.io/My-Project/doc/web/index.html

.. See `<https://github.com/daler/sphinxdoc-test>`_

.. for ideas on how to do sphinx documentation without full

.. mirroring as I do.

.. See also `<http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/>`_

.. Sphinx extension for github: `<https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github>`_

.. The problem can also be circumvented by

.. installing special Sphinx extensions ("sphinx-to-github":

.. "https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github" or "github-tools":

.. "http://pydoc.net/github-tools/0.1.3/").

Linking to source code files or other files in the project is easy:
just find the file in GitHub's web interface, choose which version of
the file you want to link to (nicely HTML formatted version or the raw
file), right-click on the link, choose *Copy Link*, and paste the
link into the document you want. You can test that the link works by
the Unix command ``curl -O <link>``. Note that the link to a file
is different from the source file's intuitive path in the repository.
Typically, a source file ``dir/f.py`` in project ``prj`` is reached
through

.. code-block:: text

        https://github.com/user/prj/blob/master/dir/f.py?raw=true

Sometimes you want to link to another HTML file, PDF file, movie file,
or a file that is to be interpreted as a web resource by the browser.
Do not use the path to the file in the repo as explained above as it will
just bring the reader to the repo page. Instead, make sure the file is in
the gh-pages branch and use a local link, like ``../doc.pdf``, or the
complete gh-pages URL to the file, say

.. code-block:: text

        http://user.github.com/My-Project/doc/misc/doc.pdf


.. admonition:: Tip

   The ordinary GitHub URL of image files can be used
   in web pages to insert images from your repo, provided the image files
   are in the *raw* format - click the *Raw* button when viewing a file at
   ``github.com`` and use the corresponding URL in the ``img`` tag in
   the HTML code.




User web pages  (2)
-------------------

GitHub also allows you to create user pages and organization pages not
tied to any specific project.
Your personal site has address
``http://user.github.com``.
Go to your home page on ``github.com`` and click *New repository*,
and give it the project name ``user.github.com``.
Then follow the instructions that come up:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> mkdir user.github.com
        Terminal> cd user.github.com
        Terminal> git init
        Terminal> # make an index.html file with some test text
        Terminal> git add index.html
        Terminal> git commit -m 'First commit'
        Terminal> git remote add origin \
                  git@github.com:user/user.github.com.git
        Terminal> git push -u origin master

Go to ``http://user.github.com`` and see how the ``index.html`` is
rendered. You can now add various contents as in any ordinary
Git repository.
If you want to use Sphinx generated HTML pages, recall to add an empty file
``.nojekyll``.

.. Use gh-pages in a subdirectory of the master branch: `<https://gist.github.com/825950>`_
