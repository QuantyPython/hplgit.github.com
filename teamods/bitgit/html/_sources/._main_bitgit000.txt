Version control systems allow you to record the history of files and
share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. Especially when working with software development or
technical writing, it is essential to have file changes documented and
to ensure that every computer and person involved in the project have
the most recent updates of the files.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud", here called *project hosting services*. For efficient access
to the files, and the possibility to work offline, you interact with
local copies of the files on your computers.
I strongly recommend you to use such sites and version control for *all*
serious programming and scientific writing work.


.. admonition:: Essence

   The essence of project hosting services is that you have the files
   associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
   files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
   update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
   synchronize the files with the "master version" in the cloud.
   It is a trivial operation to go back to a previous
   version of a file, corresponding to a certain point of time or
   labeled with a comment.
   You can also use tools to see
   what various people have done with the files throughout the history
   of the project.
