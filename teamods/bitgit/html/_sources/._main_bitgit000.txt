Need-to-Know Intro to Version Control Systems and Project Hosting Services
==========================================================================

Version control systems allow you to record the history of files and
share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. Especially when working with software development or
technical writing, it is essential to have file changes documented and
to ensure that every computer and person involved in the project have
the most recent updates of the files.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud", here called *project hosting services*. For efficient access
to the files, and the possibility to work offline, you interact with
local copies of the files on your computers.
I strongly recommend you to use such sites and version control for *all*
serious programming and scientific writing work.
