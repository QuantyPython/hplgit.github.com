<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>

<p>
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. Especially when working
with software development or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson's excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud", but with a local copy for efficient access on your
computers. I strongly recommend you to use such sites for <em>all</em>
serious programming and scientific writing work - and all other
important files.

<h3>Why not Dropbox or Google Drive?  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them and when the different versions are not annotated with
sensible comments. Another deficiency of Dropbox and Google Drive is
that they sync all your files in a folder, a feature one does not
want if there are many large files (simulation data, visualizations,
movies, temporary scratch files, automatically generated copies)
that can easily be regenerated.

<p>
However, the most serious problem with Dropbox and Google Drive
arises when several people edit files simultaneously: it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools, which
means a true version control
system.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with Git, the leading version control system,
and project hosting services for file storage.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Essence.</b>
The essence with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" in the cloud.
It is a trivial operation to go back to a previous
version of a file, corresponding to a certain point of time or
labeled with a comment,
You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.
</div>


<h3>Project hosting services  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Four popular project hosting services are

<p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://bigbucket.org" target="_self">Bitbucket</a> at <code>bitbucket.org</code></li>
  <li> <a href="http://github.com" target="_self">GitHub</a> at <code>github.com</code></li>
  <li> <a href="http://code.google.com" target="_self">Googlecode</a> at <code>code.google.com</code></li>
  <li> <a href="https://launchpad.net" target="_self">Launchpad</a> at <code>launchpad.net</code></li>
  <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" target="_self">Sourceforge</a> at <code>sourceforge.net</code></li>
</ul>

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three, but the development of it seems to
have stalled.
All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.

<p>
After the recipes on how to be up and going with project hosting
services, there is an introduction to Git. One can find
a lot of Git tutorials on the web so you might ask why
yet another one. Traditionally, Git introductions have been quite
technical, aimed at professional programmers.
The material on Git in this document grew out my need to provide
students in course with <em>minimal</em> information on how they can
archive and hand in all their computer-based course work in Git.
The coming text therefore gets you up and going very fast.
More advanced features of Git (branching, stashing, forking, merging),
which enhances the reliability of your work,
are introduced subsequently, but are not required for beginners.
Thereafter, your Git background should be firm enough to
easily access the many references I provide to material on the web.

<h3>Repositories and local copies  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
The mentioned services host all your files in a specific project in what
is known as a <em>repository</em>, or <em>repo</em> for short.  When a copy of the
files are wanted on a certain computer, one clones the repository on
that computer.  This creates a local copy of the files. Now files can
be edited, new ones can be added, and files can be deleted.  These
changes are then brought back to the repository.  If users at
different computers synchronize their files frequently with the
repository, most modern version control systems will be able to merge
changes in files that have been edited simultaneously on different
computers. This is perhaps one of the most useful features of project
hosting services. However, the merge functionality clearly works best
for pure text files and less well for binary files, such as PDF files,
MS Word or Excel documents, and OpenOffice documents.

<h3>What to choose?  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
It might seem challenging to pick the project hosting service
and the version control system that are right for you. Below
is some very personal advice.

<p>

<ul>
 <li> I would recommend Git as the default choice of version control system.
   It is simply superior in many aspects, but for a beginner the superior
   merge functionality is most useful.</li>
 <li> If you need private repos and you are not a student, choose
   Bitbucket unless you are willing to pay for private repos at GitHub.</li>
 <li> If you want to make links to your programs in documentation,
   stay away from Bitbucket as this site embeds the version of the
   file into its URL (but you can get around this problem with a trick
   described in the section <a href="#bitgit:bitbucket:URLs">Linking to Bitbucket files</a>).</li>
 <li> If you want to easily drop HTML files for documentation around in
   your repo, Googlecode will display them as web pages right away,
   while the procedure on GitHub is technically more complicated
   (Bitbucket does not yet support web pages as part of a project).
   Unfortunately, Googlecode does not allow MathJax for rendering
   LaTeX mathematics in HTML files, but MathJax works well in
   HTML files at GitHub.</li>
 <li> If a few collaborate on a project and everyone wants to be notified
   in email about changes in project files, the procedure on
   Bitbucket and Googlecode is easier to use than the one on GitHub.</li>
</ul>

For the examples below, assume that you have some directory tree
<code>my-project</code> with files that you want to host at Bitbucket, GitHub, or
Googlecode and bring under version control. The official name of the
project is "My Project".

<h3>Installing Git  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
The installation of Git on various systems is described
on the <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_self">Git website</a> under the <em>Download</em> section.
Git involves compiled code so it is most convenient to download a
precompiled binary version of the software on Windows, Mac and other
Linux computers.
On Ubuntu or any Debian-based system the relevant installation command is
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; sudo apt-get install git gitk git-doc</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
This tutorial explains Git interaction through command-line applications
in a terminal window. There are numerous <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Graphical_Interfaces" target="_self">graphical user interfaces to
Git</a>. Three examples are
<a href="http://git-cola.github.com/downloads.html" target="_self">git-cola</a>,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/" target="_self">TortoiseGit</a>, and
<a href="http://sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_self">SourceTree</a>.

<p>
Make a file <code>.gitconfig</code> in your home directory with information on
your full name, email address, your favorite text editor, and
the name of an "excludes file" which defines the file types that Git
should omit when bringing new directories under version control.
Here is a simplified version of the author's <code>.gitconfig</code> file:
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc dat) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">[user]
name = Hans Petter Langtangen
email = hpl@simula.no
editor = emacs

[core]
excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
</pre></div>
<p>
The "excludes file" is called <code>.gitignore</code> and must list,
using the Unix Shell Wildcard notation,
the type of files that you do not need to have under version control,
because they represent garbage or temporary information,
or they can easily be regenerated from
some other source files. A suggested <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/bitgit/src-bitgit/.gitignore" target="_self"><tt>.gitignore</tt></a> file looks like
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc dat) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"># compiled files:
*.o
*.so
*.a
# temporary files:
*.bak
*.swp
*~
.*~
*.old
tmp*
temp*
.#*
\#*
# tex files:
*.log
*.dvi
*.aux
*.blg
*.idx
*.nav
*.out
*.toc
*.snm
*.vrb
# eclipse files:
*.cproject
*.project
# misc:
.DS_Store
</pre></div>
<p>
Be critical to what kind of files you really need a full history of.
For example, you do not want to populate the repository with
big graphics files of the type that can easily be regenerated by
some program.

<p>
<!-- !split -->

<h2>Bitbucket <a name="bitgit:bitbucket"></a></h2>

<p>
To start using Bitbucket, go to <code>bitbucket.org</code> and create an account.
The communication channel with Bitbucket repositories is either
through SSH or HTTPS.  To use SSH, you must upload your SSH key,
typically the contents of the file <code>id_rsa.pub</code> or <code>id_dsa.pub</code> in the
<code>.ssh</code> subdirectory of your home directory. Go to the page for your
account, choose <em>SSH keys</em>, and upload one of these files.
The essence of the SSH keys is that they allow you to communicate with
Bitbucket without using a password, which is very convenient.

<p>
There are links to extensive help pages if you do not have such keys
or if you are unfamiliar with SSH. Follow these steps on Mac or Linux
machines to generate keys: 1) check that you have <code>ssh</code> installed; 2)
create a <code>.ssh</code> directory in your home directory; and 3) run
<code>ssh-keygen</code> in the <code>.ssh</code> directory (you are prompted for a
passphrase - just write something). On Windows one applies the PuTTY
and the TortoiseHG programs to generate and register keys, see the
help pages on Bitbucket. Once the keys are generated, you can continue
using them on any computer.

<h3>Creating a new project  <a name="___sec7"></a></h3>

<p>
Click at <em>Repositories</em> and at <em>Create repository</em>.
You can now

<p>

<ul>
 <li> fill in the name of the project, here <code>my-project</code>,</li>
 <li> decide whether the project is private or public (the number of
   private repos is unlimited for yourself, but you have to pay to
   invite more than five users in total to share your private repos
   unless you are <a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/2012/08/20/bitbucket-academic/" target="_self">certified to be a student or work at an academic
   institution</a>),</li>
 <li> choose between the Git or Mercurial version control system
   (here we assume you run Git),</li>
 <li> click whether you want issue tracking for reporting errors,
   suggesting improvements, etc.,</li>
 <li> click whether you want a wiki page associated with the project,</li>
 <li> fill in a brief description,</li>
 <li> click on <em>Create repository</em>.</li>
</ul>

While doing this you may also want to have the <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101" target="_self">Bitbucket 101 guide</a>
available.

<p>
It is now time to <em>clone</em> (copy) the project to your laptop.
Go to the project page
(you are automatically
brought to the project page when creating a new project).
Find the <em>Clone</em> button, click on it, choose
<em>SSH</em>, copy the <em>clone</em> line and run this command in a terminal:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git clone git@bitbucket.org:user/my-project.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You must replace <code>user</code> with your own username at Bitbucket and
<code>my-project</code> by the real project name.

<p>
The first time you do the clone command you may be prompted by cryptic
Unix output ending with "Are you sure you want to continue connecting
(yes/no)?".  Just answer yes.

<p>
The next step is to collect files and directories that should make up
the project and put them in the <code>my-project</code> directory.
Standing in the <code>my-project</code> directory, the following Git command is used
to add all files in the current
directory <em>tree</em>, except those having file types listed in <code>.gitignore</code>:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git add .</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Thereafter, the changes to the repository (here adding of files) must
<em>committed</em> (registered):
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;Initial import of files.&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The text following the <code>-am</code> option is a required description of the
changes that have taken place. This description does not matter much
for this initial import of files into the repository, but is of
importance for future commit commands so that you can easily track the
history of your project files and inform others (and yourself) what you have
done with the files.

<p>
The final step is to push the local changes to the master repo at
Bitbucket:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push -u origin master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You must be connected to the Internet for the <code>push</code> command to work since
it sends file information to the <code>bitbucket.org</code> site.

<p>
Further work with the files must always follow the pull, edit, commit, and
push steps explained in
the section <a href="#bitgit:git">Using Git</a> for Git.

<h4>Collaborating  <a name="___sec8"></a></h4>

<p>
There is a button <em>Send invitation</em> on the project home page where you
can invite other Bitbucket users to have push (write) access to your
repo. Many prefer to be notified in email when changes are pushed to
the repo: click the settings wheel to the right, choose <em>Services</em>,
then <em>Email</em>, and fill in the email addresses that are to receive
notifications on updates. Under <em>Access management</em> you can fill in
the Bitbucket names of users who are have pull (read)
or push (write) access to the repo.

<h3>User web pages <a name="bitgit:bitbucket:web"></a></h3>

<p>
Bitbucket can host web pages associated with a Bitbucket account,
but does not yet offer web pages as part of a project. Say
your account/username is <code>user</code>.  Make a new repository on
Bitbucket called <code>user.bitbucket.org</code>.  Clone it, fill it with a
file, and push back, e.g.,

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git clone git@bitbucket.org:user/user.bitbucket.org.git</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; cd user.bitbucket.org</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; echo &quot;Welcome to my web pages!&quot; &gt; test.html</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git add test.html</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;First web page&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You can now load the URL <code>http://user.bitbucket.org/test.html</code> into
a web browser and view the page. By creating various subdirectories
you can host web pages for a series of projects in this repo.

<h3>Linking to Bitbucket files <a name="bitgit:bitbucket:URLs"></a></h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, the default URL shown in your browser to a file in
a Bitbucket repo contains information about the version of the file.
For example, a file <code>v1.c</code> under Git might appear with the URL

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://bitbucket.org/user/proj/src/5fb228107044/dir/v1.c?at=master
</pre></div>
<p>
The string <code>5fb228107044</code>, called commit hash,
is connected to the version of this file
and will change when the file is updated. Such varying URLs are
useless when you to link to
the file in documents. To make a stable link to the
latest version of a file (in a public repo),
replace the commit hash by <code>master</code> and remove
the final <code>?at=master</code>:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://bitbucket.org/user/proj/src/master/dir/v1.c
</pre></div>
<p>
Other endings of the URL with commit hash, e.g., <code>?at=default</code>,
requires the hash to be replaced by <code>default</code>.

<p>
<!-- !split -->

<h2>Googlecode <a name="bitgit:googlecode"></a></h2>

<p>
To use Googlecode you need a general account on Google, which allows
you to use Gmail, Google Docs, and other Google services.
Googlecode offers free file hosting, but all the files are public and
open to the world.

<h3>Creating a new project  <a name="___sec12"></a></h3>

<p>
Go to <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting" target="_self"><tt>http://code.google.com/hosting</tt></a> and click on
<em>Creating a new project</em>. Fill out <em>all</em> the fields. For now
the project name is <code>my-project</code>.
You can
choose between Git, Mercurial, or Subversion as version control
system for your project, and this choice is difficult to change later.
If you choose Git, you must create a file <code>.netrc</code> in your
home directory containing the line
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc dat) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">machine code.google.com login uname password pw
</pre></div>
<p>
Here, <code>uname</code> is your username for the Google account and
<code>pw</code> is the Googlecode password which is generated for you on
<a href="https://code.google.com/hosting/settings" target="_self"><tt>https://code.google.com/hosting/settings</tt></a> when you
are logged in.
The <code>.netrc</code> file avoids typing or pasting in
your long and complicated password every time you push changes to
the repository on <code>code.google.com</code>.

<p>
The next step is to clone the empty repository on your local machine
so that you can add files:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git clone https://code.google.com/p/my-project/</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Now you can go to the <code>my-project</code> directory and add files.
Perform
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git add .</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;First import of files.&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Click on <em>Source</em> and
<em>Browse</em> on the project's web page, and observe that the added
files are visible on the project page.

<p>
A very strong and useful feature with Googlecode, in my opinion, is
that one can place documentation of the project anywhere in
the repository, and HTML and PDF will be correctly shown in
web browsers. (All other project hosting sites
demands either wiki pages or special web areas for locating documentation.)
The URL to your files is
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc dat) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://my-project.googlecode.com/git/
</pre></div>
<p>
For other version control systems just replace <code>git</code> by
<code>hg</code> or <code>svn</code>.
For example, if we have HTML documentation of our project in
the directory <code>doc/html</code>, we can point users to
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc dat) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://my-project.googlecode.com/git/doc/html/index.html
</pre></div>
<p>
The HTML will be rendered correctly as opposed to when you load
the similar file into the web browser from the repository,
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc dat) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://code.google.com/p/my-project/source/browse/doc/html/index.html
</pre></div>
<p>
Now you can only see the HTML source code of this file, as is usual
on other project hosting sites. We remark that MathJax
mathematics within the HTML code is <em>not</em> rendered correctly. At the
time of this writing, GitHub is the only service that offers full
MathJax support when you need web pages with mathematics.

<p>
You can click on <em>Project Home</em> and then on <em>Administer</em> to edit the
main page of the project. This is a wiki, using Google's wiki syntax,
but it is quite easy to add links to your documentation, e.g.,
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc dat) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Browse the
[https://my-project.googlecode.com/git/doc/API/html/index.html
API documentation].
</pre></div>
<p>
It is easy to allow others to push their changes to the
repository: click on <em>Sharing</em> and then on <em>Administer</em>.
The Google account names of people you allow push (write) access can be
listed under each other in the <em>Project committers</em> field.

<h3>Wiki pages  <a name="___sec13"></a></h3>

<p>
Wiki pages can intuitively be made directly in the browser. However,
it is often more convenient to have them locally on your computer.
Click on <em>Source</em> and choose <em>wiki</em> on the <em>Repository</em> pull down menu.
The proper clone command to get a copy of the wiki repository then
appears.

<p>
Googlecode applies their own Google wiki format. My preference is
to write documentation in the neutral <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" target="_self">Doconce</a> format and transform the document to LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, and Google wiki.
The wiki can then be copied from the project directories to the
wiki directory and then pushed to the repository. This ensures
that there is only one source of the documentation (despite the need
for many formats) and that the wiki pages are frequently updated.

<h2>GitHub <a name="bitgit:github"></a></h2>

<p>
Go to <code>github.com</code> and create an account. Then go to your account
settings (icon in the upper left corner of the page),
choose <em>SSH Keys</em>, and provide your SSH key
unless you have already registered this key with another GitHub
account (see Appendix <a href="#appendix:github:multiple:accounts">Appendix: Working with multiple GitHub accounts</a>).
Often, it is just a
matter of pasting the contents of <code>id_rsa.pub</code> or <code>id_dsa.pub</code> files,
located in the
<code>.ssh</code> subdirectory of your home directory, into the <em>Key</em> box in the
web page. Make sure to just cut and paste the text from, e.g., <code>id_rsa.pub</code>
without any extra whitespaces or other text. How to generate these
files is described in the link <em>generating SSH keys</em> above the SSH Keys
box (or see the introduction to Bitbucket above).

<p>
If the account is a project account and not a personal account,
I do not recommend to provide an SSH key although it can be
done (see Appendix <a href="#appendix:github:multiple:accounts">Appendix: Working with multiple GitHub accounts</a>). It is easier
to log in and add collaborators using their personal GitHub usernames.

<h3>Creating a new project  <a name="___sec15"></a></h3>

<p>
Click on <em>New repository</em> on the main page and fill out a project
name, here <em>My Project</em>, click the check button <em>Initialize this
repository with a README</em>, and click on <em>Create repository</em>.
Unless you pay, all repos are public, but students and teachers
can request <a href="https://github.com/edu" target="_self">free, private repos</a>.

<p>
The next step is to clone the project on your personal computer. Click
on the <em>SSH</em> button to see the address of the project, and
paste this address into a terminal window, after <code>git clone</code>:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git clone git://github.com:user/My-Project.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Make sure you substitute <code>user</code> by your own username on GitHub.

<p>
The result of the <code>git clone</code> command is a new directory <code>My-Project</code>.
It contains the file <code>.git</code>, which shows that it is a Git repository.
It also contains a default <code>README.md</code> file with the project name and
description. The extension <code>.md</code> signifies a file written in the
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_self">Markdown</a> format.
You may use the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html" target="_self">reStructuredText</a> format as an alternative
(<code>README.rst</code>), or simply write a plain text file (<code>README</code>),
but the <code>git mv</code> command must be used to change the filename.

<p>
You can now add files and directories into the <code>My-Project</code> directory.
When your initial file collection has the desired form, you must
run
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git add .</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;First set of files.&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push -u origin master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The daily file operations are explained in the section <a href="#bitgit:git">Using Git</a>.

<h4>Collaborating  <a name="___sec16"></a></h4>

<p>
To give others permissions to push their edits of files to the
repository, you click on the <em>Settings</em> link in the right sidebar,
then click on <em>Collaborators</em> on the left, and fill in the name
of a collaborator (her or his username on GitHub).
Many find it convenient to be notified in email when others have
pushed a new version of the files to the repo. Click on <em>Service Hooks</em>
in the project's <em>Settings</em> menu, choose <em>Email</em>, fill in
at most two whitespace-separated email addresses, mark the
<em>Send from Author</em> and <em>Active</em> boxes, and click on <em>Update Settings</em>.
More addresses must be dealt with through a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7015300/receiving-emails-on-git-push" target="_self">mailing list</a>
and filling in the name of that list.

<p>
Anyone who participates in a project (has write access) or watches a
project (having clicked the <em>watch</em> button) can monitor the
development of the activity on their GitHub main page. Go to <em>Account Settings</em>
and choose <em>Notification Center</em>.  There you see two sections,
<em>Participating</em> and <em>Watching</em>, for those participating in the project
(granted write access) and those watching the project (having clicked
the <em>watch</em> button), respectively.
<!-- No, this doesn't work: Clicking the <em>Email</em> button turns -->
<!-- on email notifications to those participating and/or watching. -->

<h3>Wiki pages  <a name="___sec17"></a></h3>

<p>
With every GitHub project there is an option to create wiki pages.
Click on the <em>Wiki</em> button in the right sidebar on the main page
of the project. Click on <em>New Page</em> to create
a new page. The wiki pages can be written in different markup
languages. Markdown is the default choice, but you can alternatively
use MediaWiki (the LaTeX-supported markup used for
Wikipedia) and reStructuredText (unfortunately not the Sphinx extension
with nice LaTeX mathematics).

<p>
The wiki pages can be written and maintained through the web browser
interface, but it is usually more convenient to clone them on
your computer as this makes it easy to add figures and other documents
you may want to link to. It also makes it straightforward to edit
the wiki text in your favorite text editor. The wiki pages are
stored in a separate repo and can be cloned by
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git clone git://github.com/user/My-Project.wiki.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
This command makes a local copy of the pages in the directory
<code>My-Project.wiki</code>, which you may prefer to have at the same level
as the project directory itself in your directory tree.

<p>
Each wiki page has its own file, where the extension reflects
the markup language used, e.g., <code>.md</code> for Markdown, <code>.rest</code> for
reStructuredText, <code>.mediawiki</code> for MediaWiki,
and <code>.creole</code> for Creole wiki. The wiki files are handled as other files in a
GitHub project, i.e., you need to pull before editing and then
perform commit and push. After the push you can reload the page
in the web browser to monitor the effect.

<p>
You may consider having the original text in <code>doconce</code> format and
generate the wiki in the reStructuredText or MediaWiki format.

<p>
Do changes, commit the usual way, and push by
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push git@github.com:user/My-project.wiki.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The address can be stored as <code>url</code> in <code>.git/config</code> in the
root directory of the wiki project so that just a
<code>git push</code> works.

<h3>Project web pages  <a name="___sec18"></a></h3>

<p>
HTML pages stored in your repo cannot be linked to and properly
rendered as web pages.
Links to HTML files at GitHub will be either rendered as nicely typeset
HTML code or as plain text.

<p>
Quite often you want to create a set of HTML pages to document your
project. This can be done as part of your repo, but you must apply
a special technique consisting in creating a separate <em>gh-pages</em>
branch in Git and making the HTML files in this particular branch.
The recipe is described in detail below.

<p>

<ol>
<li> Go to the  project page on <code>github.com</code> and click <em>Settings</em>.</li>
<li> Click on <em>Automatic Page Generator</em> under the <em>GitHub Pages</em>.</li>
<li> Proceed clicking <em>Continue to Layouts</em>, choose
   a design of the <code>index.html</code> page that GitHub will
   create for you, and click <em>Publish</em>.</li>
<li> Go to the root directory of the project, <code>My-Project</code>
   and run <code>git fetch origin</code>.</li>
<li> Run <code>git checkout gh-pages</code>.</li>
</ol>

You have now a <em>new branch</em> called gh-pages of your project
containing an <code>index.html</code> file and directories for JavaScript
programs and CSS style sheets in the root directory. The gh-pages
branch will also all files <em>not</em> contained in the <em>master branch</em>,
typically redundant files you have generated and which should not be
stored in the version control system (remove these manually with <code>git
rm</code>).  You can populate the root directory and subdirectories of your
gh-pages branch with HTML and other files as you like. The key issue
is that the people out there will only see the web pages that
correspond to your HTML files in the gh-pages branch!

<p>
The <code>index.html</code> page is invoked by the web address

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://user.github.io/My-Project/index.html
</pre></div>
<p>
where <code>user</code> is the GitHub
username and <code>My-Project</code> is the project name.

<p>
<!-- Update this info when I have maintained gh-pages for a while! -->
<!-- Could also have a special section on branching in git (above, -->
<!-- then the info here is simple... YES!). -->

<p>
The web pages and project files are now in two different branches.
To see the branches, type <code>git branch</code> and the one you are in will
be marked with <code>*</code> in the output. Switching to the master branch
is done by <code>git checkout master</code>. Similarly, <code>git checkout gh-pages</code>
switches to the gh-pages branch.

<p>
My personal preference is to have the master and gh-pages
synchronized, at least in projects where I want to link to various
source code files or other files from the web documentation.
Sometimes I also update files in the gh-pages branch without
remembering to switch to the master branch.  To this end, one needs
to <em>merge</em> the branches, i.e., automatically edit files
in the current branch such that they are up-to-date and
identical to files in another branch.

<p>
To merge the current branch with some branch named <code>otherbranch</code>, run
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge otherbranch</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Git applies smart algorithms that very often manage to merge the
files without human interaction. However, occasionally these algorithms
are not able to resolve conflicts between two files.
A message about the failure of the merge is seen in the terminal
window, and the corresponding files have markers in them showing
which sections that needs manual editing to resolve the conflicts.
Run
<code>git diff</code> to show the problems (you can tailor this command to your
needs as explained in the section <a href="#bitgit:git:fetch">Replacing pull by fetch and merge</a>). After a manual
edit, do <code>git commit -a</code>. More details on merging appears
in the section <a href="#bitgit:git:merge">Merging files with Git</a>.

<p>
If you want to keep the master branch and the gh-pages branch
synchronized,
start with merging the gh-pages branch with the master
branch and push the complete file collection to the gh-pages branch.
Then switch to the master
branch and merge with gh-pages so you get the autogenerated
<code>index.html</code> file and associated files and directories for web pages
in the root directory of the master branch as well:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; touch .nojekyll</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge gh-pages</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You <em>must</em> add an empty file <code>.nojekyll</code> in the top
directory of the project pages if you want to use Sphinx-generated
HTML pages (or other pages using javascripts, style sheets, and images
in subdirectories whose names start with an underscore).

<p>
You can now add the documentation to the project files and
maintain them in the master branch.
Before publishing documents online,
make sure to update the gh-pages branch by

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;Ensure commit of master branch&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git pull origin gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Personally, I like to move the generated <code>index.html</code> file and all
associated scripts, stylesheets, and images from the root directory to
some more isolated place, say <code>doc/web</code>:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git mv index.html params.json stylesheets/ images/ \</span>
<span style="color: #888888">                 javascripts/ doc/web/</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The URL of the <code>index.html</code> file is
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://user.github.io/My-Project/doc/web/index.html

<p>
<!-- See <a href="https://github.com/daler/sphinxdoc-test" target="_self"><tt>https://github.com/daler/sphinxdoc-test</tt></a> -->

<!-- Sphinx extension for github: <a href="https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github" target="_self"><tt>https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github</tt></a> -->

<!-- installing special Sphinx extensions ("sphinx-to-github": -->
<!-- "https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github" or "github-tools": -->
<!-- "http://pydoc.net/github-tools/0.1.3/"). -->

<p>
Linking to source code files or other files in the project is easy:
just find the file in GitHub's web interface, choose which version of
the file you want to link to (nicely HTML formatted version or the raw
file), right-click on the link, choose <em>Copy Link</em>, and paste the
link into the document you want. You can test that the link works by
the Unix command <code>curl -O <link></code>. Note that the link to a file
is different from the source file's intuitive path in the repository.
Typically, a source file <code>dir/f.py</code> in project <code>prj</code> is reached
through
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://github.com/user/prj/blob/master/dir/f.py?raw=true
</pre></div>
<p>
Sometimes you want to link to another HTML file, PDF file, movie file,
or a file that is to be interpreted as a web resource by the browser.
Do not use the path to the file in the repo as explained above as it will
just bring the reader to the repo page. Instead, make sure the file is in
the gh-pages branch and use a local link, like <code>../doc.pdf</code>, or the
complete gh-pages URL to the file, say
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://user.github.com/My-Project/doc/misc/doc.pdf
</pre></div>
<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
The ordinary GitHub URL of image files can be used
in web pages to insert images from your repo, provided the image files
are in the <em>raw</em> format - click the <em>Raw</em> button when viewing a file at
<code>github.com</code> and use the corresponding URL in the <code>img</code> tag in
the HTML code.
</div>


<h3>User web pages  <a name="___sec19"></a></h3>

<p>
GitHub also allows you to create user pages and organization pages not
tied to any specific project.
Your personal site has address
<code>http://user.github.com</code>.
Go to your home page on <code>github.com</code> and click <em>New repository</em>,
and give it the project name <code>user.github.com</code>.
Then follow the instructions that come up:

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->

Go to <code>http://user.github.com</code> and see how the <code>index.html</code> is
rendered. You can now add various contents as in any ordinary
Git repository.
If you want to use Sphinx generated HTML pages, recall to add an empty file
<code>.nojekyll</code>.

<h2>Using Git <a name="bitgit:git"></a></h2>

<p>
Most Mac and Linux users prefer to work with Git via commands in a
terminal window. Windows users may prefer a graphical user interface (GUI),
and there are many <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis" target="_self">options</a> in
this respect. There are also GUIs for Mac users.
Here we concentrate on the efficient command-line interface to Git.

<h3>Basic Git commands  <a name="___sec21"></a></h3>

<h4>Cloning  <a name="___sec22"></a></h4>

<p>
You get started with your project on a new machine, or another user
can get started with the project,
by running
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git clone git@github.com:user/My-Project.git</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; cd My-Project</span>
<span style="color: #888888">ls</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Recall to replace <code>user</code> by your real username and <code>My-Project</code> by the
actual project name.

<h4>The pull-change-push cycle  <a name="___sec23"></a></h4>

<p>
The typical work flow with the "My Project" project starts with
updating the local repository by going to the <code>My-Project</code> directory
and writing
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git pull origin master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You may want to do <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> instead
of <code>git pull</code> as explained in the section <a href="#bitgit:git:fetch">Replacing pull by fetch and merge</a>,
especially if you work with branches.

<p>
You can now edit files, make new files, and make new directories.
New files and directories must be added with <code>git add</code>.
There are also Git commands for deleting, renaming, and moving
files. Typical examples on these Git commands are
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git add file2.* dir1 dir2  # add files and directories</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git rm file3</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git rm -r dir2</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git mv oldname newname</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git mv oldname ../newdir</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
When your chunk of work is ready,
it is time to commit your changes (note the <code>-am</code> option):
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;Description of changes.&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
If typos or errors enter the message, the <code>git commit --amend</code> command
can be used to reformulate the message.  Running <code>git diff</code> prior to
<code>git commit</code> makes it
easier to formulate descriptive commit messages since this command
gives a listing of all the changes you have made to the files since
the last commit or pull command.

<p>
You may perform many commits, to keep track of small changes, before
you push your changes to the global repository:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
It is recommended to push and pull frequently if the work takes place in several
clones of the repo (i.e., there are many users or you work with the
repo on different
computers). Infrequent push and pull easily leads to merge problems
(see the section <a href="#bitgit:git:merge">Merging files with Git</a>). Also remember that others
cannot get your changes before they are pushed.

<p>
To see the status of files, run
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git status -s</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Files are marked with different symbols, e.g.,
<code>A</code> for added, <code>M</code> for modified, <code>R</code> for renamed,
and <code>??</code> for not being registered in the repo.

<h4>Viewing the history of files  <a name="___sec24"></a></h4>

<p>
A nice graphical tool allows you to view all changes, or just
the latest ones:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; gitk --all</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; gitk --since=&quot;2 weeks ago&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You can also view changes to all files, some selected ones, or
a subdirectory:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git log -p                 # all changes to all files</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git log -p filename        # changes to a specific file</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git log --stat --summary   # compact summary</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git log --stat --summary subdir</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Adding <code>--follow</code> will print the history of file versions before the
file got its present name.

<p>
To show the author who is responsible for the last modification of each
line in the file, use <code>git blame</code>:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git blame filename</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git blame --since=&quot;1 week&quot; filename</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
A useful command to see the history of who did what, where individual
edits of words are highlighted (<code>--word-diff</code>), is
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">git log -p --stat --word-diff filename</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Removed words appear in brackets and added words in curly braces.

<p>
Looking for when a particular piece of text entered or left the file,
say the text <code>def myfunc</code>, one can run
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git log -p --word-diff --stat -S&#39;def myfunc&#39; filename</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
This is useful to track down particular changes in the files to see when
they occurred and who introduced them. One can also search for regular
expressions instead of exact text: just replace <code>-S</code> by <code>-G</code>.

<h4>Retrieving old files  <a name="___sec25"></a></h4>

<p>
Occasionally you need to go back to an earlier version of a file,
say its name is <code>f.py</code>. Start with viewing the history:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git log f.py</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Find a commit candidate from the list that you will compare the
present version to, copy the commit hash (string like
<code>c7673487...</code>), and run
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git diff c7673487763ec2bb374758fb8e7efefa12f16dea f.py</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
where the long string is the relevant commit hash. You can now view the
differences between the most recent version and the one in
the commit you picked (see the section <a href="#bitgit:git:fetch">Replacing pull by fetch and merge</a> for how to
configure the tools used by the <code>git diff</code> command). If you want to restore the old file, write
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout c7673487763ec2bb374758fb8e7efefa12f16dea f.py</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
To go back to another version (the most recent one, for instance),
find the commit hash with <code>git log f.py</code>, and do <code>get checkout
<commit hash> f.py</code>.

<p>
If <code>f.py</code> changed name from <code>e.py</code> at some point and you want
<code>e.py</code> back, run <code>git log --follow f.py</code> to find the commit
when <code>e.py</code> existed, and do a <code>git checkout <commit hash> e.py</code>.

<p>
Often you just need to <em>view</em> the old file, not replace the current
one by the old one, and then <code>git show</code> is handy. Unfortunately,
it requires the full path from the root git directory:
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git show \</span>
<span style="color: #888888">          c7673487763ec2bb374758fb8e7efefa12f16dea:dir1/dir2/f.py</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Reset the entire repo to an old version  <a name="___sec26"></a></h4>

<p>
Run <code>git log</code> on some file and find the commit hash of the date
or message when want to go back to. Run <code>git checkout <commit hash></code>
to change all files to this state.
The problem of going back to the most recent state is that <code>git log</code>
has no newer commits than the one you checked out. The trick is to say
<code>git checkout master</code> to set all files to most recent version again.

<h4>Going back to the last commit  <a name="___sec27"></a></h4>

<p>
Sometimes accidents with many files happen and you want to go back
to the last commit. Find the hash of the last commit and do

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git reset --hard c867c487763ec2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
This command destroys <em>everything</em> you have done since the last commit.

<h3>Merging files with Git <a name="bitgit:git:merge"></a></h3>

<p>
The <code>git pull</code> command fetches new files from the repository and
tries to perform an automatic merge if there are conflicts between
the local files and the files in the repository. Alternatively,
you may run <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> to do the same
thing as described in the section <a href="#bitgit:git:fetch">Replacing pull by fetch and merge</a>.
We shall now address what do to if the merge goes wrong, which
occasionally happens.

<p>
Git will write a message in the terminal window
if the merge is unsuccessful for one or
more files. These files will have to be edited manually.
Merge markers of the type <code>>>>>></code>, <code>======</code>, and <code><<<<<</code> have been
inserted by Git to mark sections of a file where the version in the
repository differ from the local version. You must decide which
lines that are to appear in the final, merged version. When done,
perform <code>git commit</code> and the conflicts are resolved.

<p>
Graphical merge tools may ease the process of merging text files.  You
can run <code>git mergetool --tool=meld</code> to open the merge tool <code>meld</code> for
every file that needs to be merged (or specify the name of a
particular file). Other popular merge tools supported by Git are
<code>araxis</code>, <code>bc3</code>, <code>diffuse</code>, <code>ecmerge</code>, <code>emerge</code>, <code>gvimdiff</code>, <code>kdiff3</code>,
<code>opendiff</code>, <code>p4merge</code>, <code>tkdiff</code>, <code>tortoisemerge</code>, <code>vimdiff</code>, and
<code>xxdiff</code>.

<p>
Below is a Unix shell script illustrating how to make a global
repository in Git, and how two users clone this repository and
perform edits in parallel. There is one file <code>myfile</code> in the
repository.

<p>

<h3>Git working style with branching and stashing <a name="bitgit:git:branch:stash"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- git clone is without branches, say something about that in clone -->

<p>
Branching and stashing are nice features of Git that allow you to try
out new things without affecting the stable version of your files.
Usually, you extend and modify files quite often and perform a <code>git
commit</code> every time you want to record the changes in your local
repository. Imagine that you want to correct a set of errors in some
files and push these corrections immediately.  The problem is that
such a push will also include the latest, yet unfinished files that you
have committed.

<h4>Branching  <a name="___sec30"></a></h4>

<p>
A better organization of your work would
be to keep the latest, ongoing
developments separate from the more official and stable version
of the files. This is easily achieved by creating a separate branch
where new developments takes place:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git branch newstuff      # create and switch to new branch</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; # extend and modify files...</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;Modified ... Added a file on ...&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout master      # swith back to master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; # correct errors</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout newstuff    # switch to other branch</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge master         # keep branch up-to-date w/master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; # continue development work...</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;More modifications of ...&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
At some point, your developments in <code>newstuff</code>
are mature enough to be incorporated
in the master branch:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout newstuff</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge master        # synchronize newstuff w/master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge newstuff      # synchronize master w/newstuff</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You no longer need the <code>newstuff</code> branch and can delete it:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git branch -d newstuff</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
This command deletes the branch locally. To also delete the branch
in the remote repo, run

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin --delete newstuff</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Stashing  <a name="___sec31"></a></h4>

<p>
It is not possible to switch branches unless you have committed the
files in the current branch. If your work on some files is in a mess
and you want to change to another branch or fix other files in the
current branch, a
"global" commit affecting all files might be immature.  Then the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing" target="_self"><tt>git stash</tt></a> command is handy. It
records the state of your files and sets you back to the state of the
last commit in the current branch. With <code>git stash apply</code> you get the
files in this branch back to the state when you did the last <code>git
stash</code>.

<p>
Let us explain a typical case.  Suppose you have performed some
extensive edits in some files and then you are suddenly
interrupted. You need to fix some typos in some other files, commit
the changes, and push. The problem is that many files are in an
unfinished state - in hindsight you realize that those files should
have been modified in a separate branch.  It is not too late to create
that branch! First run <code>git stash</code> to get the files back to the state
they were at the last commit. Then run <code>git stash branch newstuff</code> to
create a new branch <code>newstuff</code> containing the state of the files when
you did the (last) <code>git stash</code> command.  Stashing used this way is a
convenient technique to move some immature edits after the last commit
out in a new branch for further experimental work.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
You can get the stashed files back by <code>git stash apply</code>. It is
possible to multiple <code>git stash</code> and <code>git stash apply</code>
commands. However, it is easy to run into trouble with multiple
stashes, especially if they occur in multiple branches, as it becomes
difficult to recognize which stashes that belong to which branch.  A
good advice is therefore to do <code>git stash</code> <em>only once</em> to get back to
a clean state and then move the unfinished messy files to a separate
branch with <code>git stash branch newstuff</code>.
</div>


<h3>Replacing pull by fetch and merge <a name="bitgit:git:fetch"></a></h3>

<p>
The <code>git pull</code> command actually performs two steps that are sometimes
advantageous to run separately. First, a <code>get fetch</code> is run to fetch
new files from the repository, and thereafter a <code>git merge</code> command is
run to merge the new files with your local version of the files.
While <code>git pull</code> tries to do a lot and be smart in the merge, very
often with success, the merge step may occasionally lead to
trouble. That is why it is recommended to run a <code>git merge</code>
separately, especially if you work with branches.

<p>
To fetch files from your repository at GitHub, which usually has
the nickname <code>origin</code>, you write

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git fetch origin</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
You now have the possibility to check out in detail what the differences
are between the new files and local ones:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git diff origin/master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
This command produces comparisons of the files in the current local branch
and the <code>master</code> branch at <code>origin</code> (the GitHub repo).
In this way you can exactly see the differences between branches.
It also gives you an overview of what others have done with
the files.
When you are ready to merge in the new files from the <code>master</code> branch
of <code>origin</code> with the files in the local <code>master</code> branch, you say

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge origin/master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Especially when you work with multiple branches, as outlined in
the section <a href="#bitgit:git:branch:stash">Git working style with branching and stashing</a>, it is wise to first do a
<code>get fetch origin</code> and then update each branch separately. The
<code>git fetch origin</code> command will list the branches, e.g.,

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">* master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  next</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
After updating <code>master</code> as described, you can continue with another branch:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout next</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git diff origin/next</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge origin/next</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout master</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Configuring the <code>git diff</code> command  <a name="___sec33"></a></h4>

<p>
The <code>git diff</code> command launches by default the
Unix <code>diff</code> tool in the terminal window.
Many users prefer to use other diff tools, and the desired one
can be specified in
your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. However, a much recommended approach is to
wrap a shell script around the call to the diff program, because
<code>git diff</code> actually calls the diff program with a series of
command-line arguments that will confuse diff programs that take
the names of the two files to be compared as arguments.
In <code>~/.gitconfig</code> you specify a script to do the diff:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">[diff]
external = ~/bin/git-diff-wrapper.sh
</pre></div>
<p>
It remains to write the <code>git-diff-wrapper.sh</code> script.
The  2nd and 5th command-line arguments passed to this script are the
name of the files to be compared in the diff. A typical script may
therefore look like

<p>

<!-- code=bash (from !bc shpro) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #228B22">#!/bin/sh</span>

diff <span style="color: #CD5555">&quot;$2&quot;</span> <span style="color: #CD5555">&quot;$5&quot;</span> | less
</pre></div>
<p>
Here we use the standard (and quite primitive) Unix <code>diff</code> program,
but we can replace <code>diff</code> by, e.g., <code>diffuse</code>, <code>kdiff3</code>, <code>xxdiff</code>, <code>meld</code>, <code>pdiff</code>, or others. With a Python script you can easily check
for the extensions of the files and use different diff tools for
different types of files, e.g., <code>latexdiff</code> for LaTeX files
and <code>pdiff</code> for pure text files.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Replacing all your files with those in the repo.</b>
Occasionally it becomes desirable to replace <em>all</em> files in
the local repo with those at the file hosting service.
One possibility is removing your repo and cloning again, or
use the Git commands

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fbeed5"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git fetch --all</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git reset --hard origin/master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<h3>Team work with forking and pull requests <a name="bitgit:git:team"></a></h3>

<p>
In small collaboration teams it is natural that everyone has push access
to the repo. On GitHub this is known as the <em>Shared Repository Model</em>.
As teams grow larger, there will usually be a few
people in charge who should approve changes to the files. Ordinary team members
will in this case not clone a repo and push changes, but instead
<em>fork</em> the repo and send <em>pull requests</em>, which constitutes the
<em>Fork and Pull Model</em>.

<p>
Say you want to fork the repo <code>https://github.com/somebody/proj1.git</code>.
The first step is to press the <em>Fork</em> button on the project page for
the <code>somebody/proj1</code> project on GitHub.
This action creates a new repo <code>proj1</code>, known as the forked repo,
on your GitHub account.
Clone the fork as you clone any repo:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git clone https://github.com/user/proj1.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
When you do <code>git push origin master</code>, you update your fork.
However, the original
repo is usually under development too, and you need to pull from that
one to stay up to date. A <code>git pull origin master</code> pulls from
<code>origin</code> which is your fork. To pull from the original repo, you
create a name <code>upstream</code>, either by

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git remote add upstream \</span>
<span style="color: #888888">              https://github.com/somebody/proj1.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
if you cloned with such an <code>https</code> address, or by

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git remote add upstream \</span>
<span style="color: #888888">              git@github.com:somebody/proj1.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
if you cloned with a <code>git@github.com</code> (SSH) address.
Doing a <code>git pull upstream master</code> would seem to be the command for
pulling the most recent files in
the original repo. However,
it is not recommended to update the forked repo's files this way
because heavy development of the <code>sombody/proj1</code> project may
lead to serious merge problems.
It is much better to replace the pull by a separate
<em>fetch</em> and <em>merge</em>.
The typical workflow is

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git fetch upstream           # get new version of files</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git merge upstream/master    # merge with yours</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; # Your files are up to date - ready for editing</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git commit -am &#39;Description...&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git push origin master       # store changes in your fork</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
At some point you would like to push your changes back to the original
repo <code>somebody/proj1</code>. This is done by a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_self">pull request</a>. Make sure you
have selected the right branch on the project page of your forked
project. Press the <em>Pull Request</em> button and fill out the form that
pops up.  Trusted people in the <code>somebody/proj1</code> project will now
review your changes and if they are approved, your files are merged
into the original repo. If not, there are tools for keeping a dialog
about how to proceed.

<p>
Also in small teams where everyone has push access, the fork and pull
request model is beneficial for reviewing files before the repo
is actually updated with new contributions.

<h3>Cloning a repo with multiple branches <a name="bitgit:git:clone:branches"></a></h3>

<p>
An annoying feature of Git for beginners is the fact that if you
clone a repo, you only get the <code>master</code> branch. There are seemingly
no other branches:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git branch</span>
<span style="color: #888888">* master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
To see which branches that exist in the repo, type

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git branch -a</span>
<span style="color: #888888">* master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  remotes/origin/gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  remotes/origin/master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  remotes/origin/next</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
If there is only one remote repo that
you pull/push from/to, you can simply switch branch with <code>git checkout</code>
the usual way:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git branch</span>
<span style="color: #888888">* gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout next</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git branch</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">  master</span>
<span style="color: #888888">* next</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
When you have more than one remote, which is usually the case if you have
forked a repo, see the section <a href="#bitgit:git:team">Team work with forking and pull requests</a>, you must use do a
checkout with specifying the remote branch you want:

<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout -b gh-pages --track remote/gh-pages</span>
<span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; git checkout -b next --track upstream/next</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Files can be edited, added, or removed as soon as you have done
the local checkout.

<p>
It is possible to write a little script that takes the output of
<code>git branch -a</code> after a <code>git clone</code> command and automatically check
out all branches via <code>git checkout</code>.

<h3>Git workflows  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>

<p>
Although the purpose of these notes is just to get the reader started
with Git, it must be mentioned that there are advanced features of Git
that have led to very powerful workflows with files and people,
especially for software development.  There is an official <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html" target="_self">Git
workflow model</a>
that outlines the basic principles, but it can be quite advanced for
those with modest Git knowledge.  A more detailed explanation of a
recommended workflow for beginners is given in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc/wiki/developer-instructions-git" target="_self">developer
instructions</a>
for the software package PETSc. This is highly suggested reading.  The
associated "quick summary" of Git commands for their workflow is also
useful.

<h2>Appendix: Working with multiple GitHub accounts <a name="appendix:github:multiple:accounts"></a></h2>

<p>
Working against different GitHub accounts is easy if each project you work
with on each account adds you as a collaborator. The term "you" here means your
primary username on GitHub. My strong recommendation is to always check
out a project
using your primary GitHub username.

<p>
Occasionally you want to create a new GitHub account, say for a project <code>XYZ</code>.
For such a non-personal account, do <em>not</em> provide an SSH key of any
particular user. The reason is that this user will then get two
GitHub identities, and switching between these identities will require
some special tweakings. Just forget about the SSH key for a project
account and add
collaborators to repos using each collaborators personal GitHub username.

<p>
If you really need to operate the <code>XYZ</code> account as a
personal account, you must provide an SSH key that is different from
any other key at any other GitHub account (you will get an error message
if you try to register an already registered SSH key, but it is possible to
get around the error message by providing
an <code>id_rsa.pub</code> key on one account and an <code>id_dsa.pub</code> on another - that
will cause trouble). Jeffrey Way has written a recipe for <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts/" target="_self">how to operate multiple GitHub accounts
using multiple identities</a>.

<p>
To debug which identity that is used when you pull and push to
GitHub accounts, you can first run
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; ssh -Tv git@github.com</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
to see your current identity and which SSH key that was used to identify you.
Typing
<p>

<!-- code=console (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #888888">Terminal&gt; ssh-add -l</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
lists all your SSH keys. The shown strings can be compared with the
string in the SSH key field of any GitHub account.
