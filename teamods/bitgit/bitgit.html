<p>
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work -- and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. Simply
go to <a href="http://dropbox.com"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It is very easy to get
started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share files among
laptops and mobile units.

<p>
When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
Four popular project hosting services are

<p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://bigbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> at <tt>bitbucket.org</tt></li>
  <li> <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> at <tt>github.com</tt></li>
  <li> <a href="http://code.google.com">Googlecode</a> at <tt>code.google.com</tt></li>
  <li> <a href="https://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> at <tt>launchpad.net</tt></li>
  <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> at <tt>sourceforge.net</tt></li>
</ul>

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know commands.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<p>
The mentioned services host all your files in a specific project in what
is known as a <em>repository</em>, or <em>repo</em> for short.  When a copy of the
files are wanted on a certain computer, one clones the repository on
that computer.  This creates a local copy of the files. Now files can
be edited, new ones can be added, and files can be deleted.  These
changes are then brought back to the repository.  If users at
different computers synchronize their files frequently with the
repository, most modern version control systems will be able to merge
changes in files that have been edited simultaneously on different
computers. This is perhaps one of the most useful features of project
hosting services. However, the merge functionality clearly works best
for pure text files and less well for binary files, such as PDF files,
MS Word or Excel documents, and OpenOffice documents.

<p>
<!-- Next we describe how to get started with Bitbucket and GitHub.  If you -->
<!-- are new to project hosting sites, it is recommended to read about -->
<!-- Bitbucket first, since the description of GitHub is briefer. -->

<p>
For the examples below, assume that you have some folder tree
<tt>my-project</tt> with files that you want to host at Bitbucket, GitHub, or
Googlecode and bring under version control. The official name of the
project is "My Project".

<p>

<h2>Installing version control systems  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
<p>
The various project hosting sites work with different version
control systems:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>bitbucket.org</tt> offers Git (<tt>git</tt>) or Mercurial (<tt>hg</tt>),</li>
 <li> <tt>github.com</tt> offers Git (<tt>git</tt>),</li>
 <li> <tt>code.google.com</tt> offers Git (<tt>git</tt>), Mercurial (<tt>hg</tt>), or Subversion (<tt>svn</tt>),</li>
 <li> <tt>launchpad.net</tt> offers Bazaar (<tt>bzr</tt>),</li>
 <li> <tt>sourceforge.net</tt> offers CVS (<tt>cvs</tt>), Subversion (<tt>svn</tt>), Mercurial (<tt>hg</tt>),
   Bazaar (<tt>bzr</tt>), and Git (<tt>git</tt>).</li>
</ul>

All the version control systems are quite similar in the way users
operate them, but Subversion is technically different from Git,
Mercurial, and Bazaar. The latter three work much in the same way
for a beginner, but their more advanced commands and their
nomenclature differ significantly.  Which system to choose is mainly a
matter of personal preference and experience. For some people the
choice of project hosting site comes first, while others prefer a
particular version control system and let this preference govern the
choice of the project hosting site.

<p>
It is fair to say that Git has evolved as the most versatile version
control system and is at the time of this writing (2013) the
recommended choice.  The combination of GitHub and Git seems to have
the strongest momentum and popularity in the software development
community.  Bitbucket offers private repos for free, which is a
desired feature for many. Googlecode has the advantage that any HTML
file in the repo can be used to make a web page, thereby greatly
simplifying the building of web pages for the project.

<p>



<h3>Installing Git  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>
<p>

The installation of Git on various systems is described
on the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git website</a> under the <em>Download</em> section.
On Ubuntu the relevant commands are
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">sudo apt-get install git gitk git-doc
</pre></div>
<p>
Git involves compiled code so it is most convenient to download a
precompiled binary version of the software on Windows, Mac and other
Linux computers.

<p>
Make a file <tt>.gitconfig</tt> in your home folder with information on
your full name, email address, your favorite emacs editor, and
the name of an "excludes file" which defines the file types that Git
should omit when bringing new directories under version control.
Here is a simplified version of the author's <tt>.gitconfig</tt> file:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">[user]
name = Hans Petter Langtangen
email = hpl@simula.no
editor = emacs

[core]
excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
</pre></div>
<p>

The "excludes file" is called <tt>.gitignore</tt> and must list,
using the Unix Shell Wildcard notation,
the type of files that you do not need to have under version control,
because they represent garbage or temporary information,
or they can easily be regenerated from
some other source files. A suggested <tt>.gitignore</tt> file looks like
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"># compiled files:
*.o
*.so
*.a
# temporary files:
*.bak
*.swp
*~
.*~
*.old
tmp*
temp*
# tex files:
*.log
*.dvi
*.aux
*.blg
*.idx
# eclipse files:
*.cproject
*.project
# misc:
.DS_Store
</pre></div>
<p>
Be critical to what kind of files you really need a full history of.
For example, you do not want to populate the repository with
big graphics files of the type that can easily be regenerated by
some program.

<p>


<h3>Installing Mercurial  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>
<p>

The <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial website</a> has information
on downloading Mercurial on different platforms.
On Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux systems, you just perform
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">sudo apt-get install mercurial
</pre></div>
<p>
You can alternatively click in the Ubuntu Software Center application
and choose the Mercurial package in the graphical interface.

<p>
Mercurial is pure Python code so it is trivial on any system with Python
installed to download the Mercurial source code and perform
the standard <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt> command.

<p>
This tutorial emphasizes the command-line interface to Mercurial, but there
is also a graphical interface called TortoiseHG, which can be installed
by
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">sudo apt-get install tortoisehg
</pre></div>
<p>
on Ubuntu. TortoiseHG is the natural application to run Mercurial on a
Windows machine.

<p>
We recommend that you create two files in your home folder: <tt>.hgrc</tt> for
specifying the behavior of <tt>hg</tt> (Mercurial) and <tt>.hgignore</tt> for
listing the type of files you in general do not want to have under version
control. A simple <tt>.hgrc</tt> file can look like this:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">[ui]
username = &quot;Hans Petter Langtangen &lt;hpl@simula.no&gt;&quot;
ignore=~/.hgignore
</pre></div>
<p>
The <tt>.hgignore</tt> file lists the types of files that will be skipped
when bringing new directories under Mercurial version control.
Typically, the list contains file types that represent temporary
information or just garbage, or files that are easily regenerated,
such as object files (<tt>*.o</tt>) and
libraries (<tt>*.so</tt>).
The file types are normally specified using the Unix Shell Wildcard notation,
also referred to as <tt>glob</tt> syntax (e.g., <tt>*.o</tt>, where <tt>*</tt> means any
sequence of characters).
An example of a <tt>.hgignore</tt> file may be
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">syntax: glob
# compiled files:
*.o
*.so
*.a
# temporary files:
*.bak
*.swp
*~
.*~
*.old
tmp*
temp*
# tex files:
*.log
*.dvi
*.aux
*.blg
*.idx
# eclipse files:
*.cproject
*.project
# misc:
.DS_Store
</pre></div>
<p>
In addition to having an <tt>.hgignore</tt> file, you should always be careful with
what kind of files you really need to add to your
repo. Many computer tools produce a lot of big files that can
easily be regenerated and that do not need to fill up repos with full
information on previous versions.

<p>


<h2>Bitbucket <a name="bitgit:bitbucket"></a></h2>
<p>

To start using Bitbucket, go to <tt>bitbucket.org</tt> and create an account.
The communication channel with Bitbucket repositories is either
through SSH or HTTPS.  To use SSH, you must upload your SSH key,
typically the contents of the file <tt>id_rsa.pub</tt> or <tt>id_dsa.pub</tt> in the
<tt>.ssh</tt> subfolder of your home folder. Go to the page for your
account, choose <em>SSH keys</em>, and upload one of these files.
The essence of the SSH keys is that they allow you to communicate with
Bitbucket without using a password, which is very convenient.

<p>
There are links to extensive help pages if you do not have such keys
or if you are unfamiliar with SSH. Follow these steps on Mac or Linux
machines to generate keys: 1) check that you have <tt>ssh</tt> installed; 2)
create a <tt>.ssh</tt> folder in your home folder; and 3) run
<tt>ssh-keygen</tt> in the <tt>.ssh</tt> folder (you are prompted for a
passphrase - just write something). On Windows one applies the PuTTY
and the TortoiseHG programs to generate and register keys, see the
help pages on Bitbucket. Once the keys are generated, you can continue
using them on any current and future computer.

<p>


<h3>Create a new project  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>
<p>
Click at <em>Repositories</em> and at <em>Create repository</em>.
You can now

<p>

<ul>
 <li> fill in the name of the project, here <tt>my-project</tt>,</li>
 <li> decide whether the project is private or public (the number of
   private repos is unlimited for yourself, but you have to pay to
   invite more than five users in total to share your private repos),</li>
 <li> choose between the Git or Mercurial version control system
   (here we assume you run Git),</li>
 <li> click whether you want issue tracking for reporting errors,
   suggesting improvements, etc.,</li>
 <li> click whether you want a wiki page associated with the project,</li>
 <li> fill in a brief description,</li>
 <li> click on <em>Create repository</em>.</li>
</ul>

While doing this you may also want to have the <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101">Bitbucket 101 guide</a>
available.

<p>
It is now time to <em>clone</em> (copy) the project to your laptop.
Go to the project page
(you are automatically
brought to the project page when creating a new project).
Find the <em>Clone</em> button, click on it, choose
<em>SSH</em>, copy the <em>clone</em> line and run this command in a terminal:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git clone git@bitbucket.org:usernamet/my-project.git
</pre></div>
<p>
You must replace <tt>username</tt> with your own user name at Bitbucket and
<tt>my-project</tt> by the real project name.

<p>
The first time you do the clone command you may be prompted by cryptic
Unix output ending with "Are you sure you want to continue connecting
(yes/no)?".  Just answer yes.

<p>
The next step is to collect files and directories that should make up
the project and put them in the <tt>my-project</tt> folder.
Standing in the <tt>my-project</tt> folder, the following Git command is used
to add all files in the current
directory <em>tree</em>, except those having file types listed in <tt>.gitignore</tt>:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git add .
</pre></div>
<p>

Thereafter, the changes to the repository (here adding of files) must
<em>committed</em> (registered):
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;Initial import of files.&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The text following the <tt>-am</tt> option is a required description of the
changes that have taken place. This description does not matter much
for this initial import of files into the repository, but is of
importance for future commit commands so that you can easily track the
history of your project files.

<p>
The final step is to push the local changes to the master repo at
Bitbucket:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git push -u origin master
</pre></div>
<p>
You must be connected to the Internet for the <tt>push</tt> command to work since
it sends file information to the <tt>bitbucket.org</tt> site.

<p>
Further work with the files must always follow the pull, edit, commit, and
push steps explained in the section <a href="#bitgit:hg">Using Mercurial</a> for Mercurial and
the section <a href="#bitgit:git">Using Git</a> for Git.

<p>

<h3>User web pages  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>
<p>
Bitbucket can host web pages associated with a Bitbucket account. Say
your account/user name is <tt>username</tt>.  Make a new repository on
Bitbucket called <tt>username.bitbucket.org</tt>.  Clone it, fill it with a
file, and push back, e.g.,

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/username.bitbucket.org.git
<span style="color: #008000">cd </span>username.bitbucket.org
<span style="color: #008000">echo</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Welcome to my web pages!&quot;</span> &gt; test.html
git add test.html
git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;First web page&#39;</span>
git push origin master
</pre></div>
<p>
You can now load the URL <tt>http://username.bitbucket.org/test.html</tt> into
a web browser and view the page. By creating various subfolders
you can host web pages for a series of projects in this repo.

<p>
Bitbucket does not yet offer ordinary repos to host and display
web pages.

<p>


<h2>Googlecode <a name="bitgit:googlecode"></a></h2>
<p>

To use Googlecode you need a general account on Google, which allows
you to use Gmail, Google Docs, and other products.

<p>


<h3>Create a new project  <a name="___sec7"></a></h3>
<p>
Go to <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting"><tt>http://code.google.com/hosting</tt></a> and click on
<em>Create a new project</em>. Fill out <em>all</em> the fields. For now
the project name is <tt>my-project</tt>.
You have
to choose between Git, Mercurial, or Subversion as version control
system for your project, and this choice cannot be changed.
Git and Mercurial are clearly preferred over Subversion nowadays.
If you choose Git, you must create a file <tt>.netrc</tt> in your
home folder containing the line
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">machine code.google.com login uname password pw
</pre></div>
<p>
Here, <tt>uname</tt> is your user name for the Google account and
<tt>pw</tt> is the Googlecode password which is generated for you on
the <tt>code.google.com/p/my-project</tt>.
The <tt>.netrc</tt> file avoids typing or pasting in
your long and complicated password every time you push changes to
the repository on <tt>code.google.com</tt>.

<p>
The next step is to clone the empty repository on your local machine
so that you can add files:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git clone https://code.google.com/p/my-project/
</pre></div>
<p>
Now you can go to the <tt>my-project</tt> folder and add files.
Perform
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git add .
git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;First import of files.&#39;</span>
git push origin master
</pre></div>
<p>
Click on <em>Source</em> and
<em>Browse</em> on the project's web page, and observe that the added
files are visible on the project page.

<p>
If you use Mercurial as version control system on Googlecode and
you want to avoid typing your password when you push changes to
the repository, you should add the following section to your
<tt>.hgrc</tt> file:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">[auth]
my-project.prefix = https://my-project.googlecode.com/hg/
my-project.username = uname
my-project.password = pw
</pre></div>
<p>
where <tt>uname</tt> and <tt>pw</tt> must be replaced by your account name and
the special Googlecode password. Other projects on Googlecode
using Mercurial will need similar lines.

<p>
A very strong and useful feature with Googlecode, in my opinion, is
that one can reach the repository files directly through an URL.
That means that one can place documentation of the project in
the repository and find an URL to the HTML or PDF files of the documentation,
which will then be displayed correctly. All other project hosting sites
demands either wiki pages or special web areas for locating documentation.
The URL to your files is
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://my-project.googlecode.com/git/
</pre></div>
<p>
When using other version control systems, <tt>git</tt> is simply replaced by
<tt>hg</tt> or <tt>svn</tt>.
For example, if we have HTML documentation of our project in
the folder <tt>doc/html</tt>, we can point users to
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://my-project.googlecode.com/git/doc/html/index.html
</pre></div>
<p>
The HTML will be rendered correctly as opposed to when you load
the similar file into the web browser from the repository,
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://code.google.com/p/my-project/source/browse/doc/html/index.html
</pre></div>
<p>
Now you can only see the HTML source code of this file, as is usual
on other project hosting sites. We remark that MathJax
mathematics within the HTML code is <em>not</em> rendered correctly. At the
time of this writing, GitHub is the only service that offers full
MathJax support when you need web pages with mathematics.

<p>
You can click on <em>Project Home</em> and then on <em>Administer</em> to edit the
main page of the project. This is a wiki, using Google's wiki syntax,
but it is quite easy to add links to your documentation, e.g.,
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Browse the
[https://my-project.googlecode.com/git/doc/API/html/index.html
API documentation].
</pre></div>
<p>

It is easy to allow others to push their changes to the
repository: click on <em>Sharing</em> and then on <em>Administer</em>.
The Google account names of people you allow write access can be
listed under each other in the <em>Project committers</em> field.

<p>

<h3>Wiki pages  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>
<p>
Wiki pages can intuitively be made directly in the browser. However,
it is often more convenient to have them locally on your computer.
Click on <em>Source</em> and choose <em>wiki</em> on the <em>Repository</em> pull down menu.
The proper clone command to get a copy of the wiki repository then
appears.

<p>
Googlecode applies their own Google wiki format. My preference is
to write documentation in the neutral <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doconce">Doconce</a> format and transform the document to LaTeX, Sphinx, and Google wiki.
The wiki can then be copied from the project directories to the
wiki folder and then pushed to the repository. This ensures
that there is only one source of the documentation (despite the need
for many formats) and that the wiki pages are frequently updated.

<h2>GitHub <a name="bitgit:github"></a></h2>
<p>

Go to <tt>github.com</tt> and create an account. Then go to your account
settings (icon in the upper left corner of the page),
choose <em>SSH Keys</em>, and provide your SSH key
<em>unless you have already registered this key with another GitHub
account</em> (see Appendix <a href="#appendix:github:multiple:accounts">Appendix: Working with multiple GitHub accounts</a>).  There are
help links that explain what this is all about. Often, it is just a
matter of pasting the contents of <tt>id_rsa.pub</tt> or <tt>id_dsa.pub</tt> files,
located in the
<tt>.ssh</tt> subfolder of your home folder, into the <em>Key</em> box in the
web page. Make sure to cut and paste the text from, e.g., <tt>id_rsa.pub</tt>
without any extra whitespaces or other text. How to generate these
files is described in the link <em>generating SSH keys</em> above the SSH Keys
box (or see the introduction to Bitbucket above).

<p>
If the account is a project account and not a personal account,
I do not recommend to provide an SSH key although it can be
done (see Appendix <a href="#appendix:github:multiple:accounts">Appendix: Working with multiple GitHub accounts</a>). It is easier
to log in and add collaborators using their personal GitHub usernames.

<p>


<h3>Create a new project  <a name="___sec10"></a></h3>
<p>
Click on <em>New repository</em> on the main page and fill out a project
name, here <em>My Project</em>, click the check button <em>Initialize this
repository with a README</em>, and click on <em>Create repository</em>.
Unless you pay, all repos are public, but students and teachers
can request <a href="https://github.com/edu">free, private repos</a>.

<p>
The next step is to clone the project on your personal computer. Click
on the <em>SSH</em> button to see the address of the project, and
paste this address into a terminal window, after <tt>git clone</tt>:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git clone git://github.com:username/My-Project.git
</pre></div>
<p>
Make sure you substitute <tt>username</tt> by your own user name on GitHub.

<p>
The result of the <tt>git clone</tt> command is a new folder <tt>My-Project</tt>.
It contains the file <tt>.git</tt>, which shows that it is a Git repository.
It also contains a default <tt>README.md</tt> file with the project name and
description. The extension <tt>.md</tt> signifies a file written in the
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format.
You may use the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> format as an alternative
(<tt>README.rst</tt>), or simply write a plain text file (<tt>README</tt>).

<p>
You can now add files and directories into the <tt>My-Project</tt> folder.
When your initial file collection has the desired form, you must
run
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git add .
git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;First set of files.&#39;</span>
git push -u origin master
</pre></div>
<p>

To give others permissions to push their edits of files to the
repository, you click on the <em>Settings</em> tab,
then click on <em>Collaborators</em> on the left, and fill in the name
of a collaborator (her or his user name on GitHub).
Many find it convenient to be notified in email when others have
pushed a new version of the files to the repo. Click on <em>Service Hooks</em>
(in the project's <em>Settings</em> menu), choose <em>Email</em>, and fill in
up to two whitespace-separated email addresses. One can send
to more addresses by making a mailing list.

<p>
Anyone who participates in a project (has write access) or watches a
project (having clicked the <em>watch</em> button) can monitor the
development of the activity through email. Go to <em>Account Settings</em>
and choose <em>Notification Center</em>.  There you see two sections,
<em>Participating</em> and <em>Watching</em>, for those participating in the project
(granted write access) and those watching the project (having clicked
the <em>watch</em> button), respectively.  Clicking the <em>Email</em> button turns
on email notifications to those participating and/or watching.

<p>
The daily file operations are explained in Section {bitgit:git}.
There you also find information on how to create wiki pages and
web pages associated with the project.

<p>


<h3>Wiki pages  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>
<p>
With every GitHub project there is an option to create wiki pages.
Click on the <em>Wiki</em> button right under the line with the project
name of the main page of the project. Click on <em>New Page</em> to create
a new page. The wiki pages can be written in different markup
languages. Markdown is the default choice, but you can alternatively
use reStructuredText (unfortunately not the Sphinx extension
with nice LaTeX mathematics) or MediaWiki (the markup used for
Wikipedia).

<p>
The wiki pages can be written and maintained through the web browser
interface, but it is usually more convenient to clone them on
your computer as this makes it easy to add figures and other documents
you may want to link to. It also makes it straightforward to edit
the wiki text in your favorite text editor. The wiki pages are
stored in a separate repo: click on <em>Git Access</em> and then on
<em>Git Read-Only</em> to see the
Git address for a standard <tt>git clone</tt> command, typically
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git clone git://github.com/username/My-Project.wiki.git
</pre></div>
<p>
This command makes a local copy of the pages in the folder
<tt>My-Project.wiki</tt>, which you may prefer to have at the same level
as the project folder itself in your folder tree.

<p>
Each wiki page has its own file, where the extension reflects
the markup language used, e.g., <tt>.md</tt> for Markdown and <tt>.rest</tt> for
reStructuredText. The wiki files are handled as other files in a
GitHub project, i.e., you need to pull before editing and then
perform commit and push. After the push you can reload the page
in the web browser to monitor the effect.

<p>
You may consider having the original text in <tt>doconce</tt> format and
generate the wiki in reStructuredText format.

<p>
Do changes, commit the usual way, and push by
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git push git@github.com:username/My-project.wiki.git
</pre></div>
<p>
The address can be stored as <tt>url</tt> in <tt>.git/config</tt> so that just a
<tt>git push</tt> works.

<p>


<h3>Project web pages  <a name="___sec12"></a></h3>
<p>
GitHub can also host a set of web pages for your project where you can
store various types of documentation. Here is a simple
recipe for creating a set of project web pages.

<p>

<ol>
<li> Go to the  project page on <tt>github.com</tt> and click <em>Settings</em>.</li>
<li> Click on generating <em>GitHub Pages</em>.</li>
<li> Proceed with choosing a design of the <tt>index.html</tt> page and click <em>Publish</em>.</li>
<li> Go to the root folder of the project, <tt>My-Project</tt>
   and run <tt>git fetch origin</tt>.</li>
<li> Run <tt>git checkout gh-pages</tt>.</li>
</ol>

You have now a <em>new branch</em> called <tt>gh-pages</tt> of your project containing an
<tt>index.html</tt> file in the root folder (and in fact all files <em>not</em>
contained in the <em>master branch</em>, typically redundant files not to be
stored in the version control system).
You can populate this folder and subdirectories you create with
HTML and other files as you like.

<p>
The <tt>index.html</tt> page is invoked by the web address

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://username.github.com/My-Project/index.html
</pre></div>
<p>
where <tt>username</tt> is the GitHub
user name and <tt>My-Project</tt> is the project name.

<p>
<!-- Update this info when I have maintained gh-pages for a while! -->
<!-- Could also have a special section on branching in git (above, -->
<!-- then the info here is simple... YES!). -->

<p>
The web pages and project files are now in two different branches.
To see the branches, type <tt>git branch</tt> and the one you are in will
be marked with a star in the output. Switching to the master branch
is done by <tt>git checkout master</tt>. Similarly, <tt>git checkout gh-pages</tt>
switches to the gh-pages branch.

<p>
When Git branches diverge you can merge them by
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git merge otherbranch
</pre></div>
<p>
where <tt>otherbranch</tt> is the name of another branch. If there is a conflict
in the merge, there will be markers in problematic files. Run
<tt>git diff</tt> to show the problems. After a manual edit, do
<tt>git commit -a</tt>. Then you may run <tt>gitk</tt> to see a graphical illustration
of what has happened.

<p>
My personal preference is to have the master and gh-pages
synchronized, at least in projects where I want to link to various
source code files or other files from the web documentation.
Sometimes I also update files in the gh-pages branch without
remembering to switch to the master branch.  Merging the branches is
then an easy way out of such potential trouble.

<p>
Start with merging the gh-pages branch with the master
branch and push the complete file collection to the gh-pages branch.
Then switch to the master
branch and merge with gh-pages so you get the autogenerated
<tt>index.html</tt> file and associated files and directories for the web design
in the root folder of the master branch as well:

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git merge master
touch .nojekyll
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout master
git merge gh-pages
</pre></div>
<p>
You <em>must</em> add an empty file <tt>.nojekyll</tt> in the top
folder of the project pages if you want to use Sphinx-generated
HTML pages (or other pages using javascripts, style sheets, and images
in subdirectories whose names start with an underscore).

<p>
You can now add the documentation to the project files and
maintain them in the master branch.
Before publishing documents online,
make sure to update the gh-pages branch by

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;Ensure commit of everything in master branch&#39;</span>
git push origin master
git checkout gh-pages
git merge master
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout master
</pre></div>
<p>

Personally, I like to move the generated <tt>index.html</tt> file and all
associated scripts, stylesheets, and images from the root folder to
some more isolated place, say <tt>doc/web/git</tt>:

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git mv index.html params.json stylesheets/ images/ <span style="color: #BB6622; font-weight: bold">\</span>
       javascripts/ doc/web/git/
</pre></div>
<p>
The <tt>index.html</tt> then has the URL
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://username.github.com/My-Project/doc/web/git/index.html
</pre></div>
<p>

<!-- The problem can also be circumvented by -->
<!-- installing special Sphinx extensions ("sphinx-to-github": -->
<!-- "https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github" or "github-tools": -->
<!-- "http://pydoc.net/github-tools/0.1.3/"). -->

<p>
<!-- See <a href="https://github.com/daler/sphinxdoc-test"><tt>https://github.com/daler/sphinxdoc-test</tt></a> -->
<!-- for ideas on how to do sphinx documentation without full -->
<!-- mirroring as I do. -->
<!-- See also <a href="http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/"><tt>http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/</tt></a> -->
<!-- Sphinx extension for github: <a href="https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github"><tt>https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github</tt></a> -->

<p>
Linking to source code files or other files in the project is easy:
just find the file in GitHub's web interface, choose which version of
the file you want to link to (nicely HTML formatted version or the raw
file), right-click on the link, choose <em>Copy Link</em>, and paste the
link into the document you want. You can test that the link works by
the Unix command <tt>curl -O <link></tt>. Note that the link to a file
is different from the source file's intuitive path in the repository.
Typically, a source file <tt>mydir/myfile.py</tt> in project <tt>prj</tt> is reached
through
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">https://github.com/username/prj/blob/master/mydir/myfile.py?raw=true
</pre></div>
<p>

Sometimes you want to link to another HTML file, PDF file, movie file,
or a file that is to be interpreted as a web resource by the browser.
Do not use the path to the file in the repo as explained above as it will
just bring the reader to the repo page. Instead, make sure the file is in
the gh-pages branch and use a local link, like <tt>../mydoc.pdf</tt>, or the
complete gh-pages URL to the file:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">http://username.github.com/My-Project/doc/misc/mydoc.pdf
</pre></div>
<p>


<h3>User web pages  <a name="___sec13"></a></h3>
<p>

GitHub also allows you to create user pages and organization pages not
tied to any specific project.
Your personal site has address
<tt>http://username.github.com</tt>.
Go to your home page on <tt>github.com</tt> and click <em>New repository</em>,
and give it the project name <tt>username.github.com</tt>.
Then follow the instructions that come up:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">mkdir username.github.com
<span style="color: #008000">cd </span>username.github.com
git init
<span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># make an index.html file with some test text</span>
git add index.html
git commit -m <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;First commit&#39;</span>
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/username.github.com.git
git push -u origin master
</pre></div>
<p>
Go to <tt>http://username.github.com</tt> and see how the <tt>index.html</tt> is
rendered. You can now add various contents as in any ordinary
Git repository.
If you want to use Sphinx generated HTML pages, recall to add an empty file
<tt>.nojekyll</tt>. Different projects can be hosted in different subfolders.

<p>

<!-- Use gh-pages in a subfolder of the master branch: <a href="https://gist.github.com/825950"><tt>https://gist.github.com/825950</tt></a> -->

<p>


<h2>Using Git <a name="bitgit:git"></a></h2>
<p>

Most Mac and Linux users prefer to work with Git via a commands in a
terminal window. Windows users prefer a graphical user interface (GUI).
There are many <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis">options</a> in
this respect. There are also GUIs for Mac users.
Most GUIs are easy to use once the basic concepts of Git and version
control are understood.

<p>

<h3>Basic Git commands  <a name="___sec15"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Cloning  <a name="___sec16"></a></h4>
<p>
You get started with your project on a new machine, or another user
can get started with the project,
by running
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git clone git@github.com:username/My-Project.git
<span style="color: #008000">cd </span>My-Project
ls
</pre></div>
<p>
Recall to replace <tt>username</tt> by your real user name and <tt>My-Project</tt> by the
actual project name.

<p>

<h4>The pull-change-push cycle  <a name="___sec17"></a></h4>
<p>
The typical work flow with the "My Project" project starts with
updating the local repository by going to the <tt>My-Project</tt> folder
and writing
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git pull origin master
</pre></div>
<p>

You can now edit files, add new files, delete files, or rename files.
Typical commands are
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git add file1 file2.* dir1 dir2
git rm filename
git rm -r dirname
git mv oldname newname
git mv oldname ../newdir
</pre></div>
<p>
When your chunk of work is ready,
it is time to commit your changes (note the <tt>-am</tt> option):
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;Description of changes.&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
If typos or errors enter the message, the <tt>git commit --amend</tt> command
can be used to reformulate the message.  Running <tt>git diff</tt> prior to
<tt>git commit</tt> makes it
easier to formulate descriptive commit messages since this command
gives a listing of all the changes you have made to the files since
the last commit or pull command.

<p>
You may perform many commits, to keep track of small changes, before
you push your changes to the global repository:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git push origin master
</pre></div>
<p>
It is recommended to push and pull frequently if work takes place in several
clones of the repo (i.e., there are many users or you work with the
repo on different
computers). Infrequent push and pull easily leads to merge problems
(see the section <a href="#bitgit:git:merge">Merging files with Git</a>).

<p>
To see the status of files, run
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git status -s
</pre></div>
<p>
Files are marked with different symbols, e.g.,
<tt>A</tt> for added, <tt>M</tt> for modified, <tt>R</tt> for renamed,
and <tt>??</tt> for not being registered in the repo.

<p>

<h4>Viewing the history of files  <a name="___sec18"></a></h4>
<p>
A nice graphical tool allows you to view all changes, or just
the latest ones:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">gitk --all
gitk --since<span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;2 weeks ago&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>

You can also view changes to all files or some selected ones
in the terminal window:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git log -p                        <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># all changes to all files</span>
git log -p filename               <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># all changes to a specific file</span>
git log --stat --summary          <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># compact summary of changed files</span>
git log --stat --summary  subdir  <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># only files in subdir folder</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Adding <tt>--follow</tt> will print the history of file versions before the
file got its present name.

<p>
To show the author who is responsible for the last modification of each
line in the file, use <tt>git blame</tt>:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git blame filename
git blame --since<span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;1 week&quot;</span> filename
</pre></div>
<p>
A useful command to see the history of who did what, where individual
edits of words are highlighted (<tt>--word-diff</tt>), is
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git log -p --stat --word-diff filename
</pre></div>
<p>
Removed words appear in brackets and added words in curly braces.

<p>
Looking for when a particular piece of text entered or left the file,
say the text <tt>def myfunc</tt>, one can run
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git log -p --word-diff --stat -S<span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;def myfunc&#39;</span> filename
</pre></div>
<p>
This is useful to track down particular changes in the files to see when
they occurred and who introduced them. One can also search for regular
expressions instead of exact text: just replace <tt>-S</tt> by <tt>-G</tt>.

<p>

<h4>Retrieving old files  <a name="___sec19"></a></h4>
<p>
Occasionally you need to go back to an earlier version of a file,
say its name is <tt>myfile</tt>. Start with viewing the history:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git log myfile
</pre></div>
<p>
Find a commit candidate from the list that you will compare the
present version to and copy the commit hash (string like
<tt>c7673487...</tt>) and run
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git diff c7673487763ec2bb374758fb8e7efefa12f16dea myfile
</pre></div>
<p>
where the long string is the relevant commit hash. You can now view the
differences between the most recent version and the one in
the commit you picked. If you want to restore the old file, write
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git checkout c7673487763ec2bb374758fb8e7efefa12f16dea myfile
</pre></div>
<p>
To go back to another version (the most recent one, for instance),
find the commit hash with <tt>git log myfile</tt>, and do <tt>get checkout
<commit hash> myfile</tt>.  At any time you do <tt>git commit</tt> the current
version of <tt>myfile</tt> will enter the most recent commit of the current
branch.

<p>
If <tt>myfile</tt> changed name from <tt>yourfile</tt> at some point and you want
<tt>yourfile</tt> back, run <tt>git log --follow myfile</tt> to find the commit
when <tt>yourfile</tt> existed, and do a <tt>git checkout <commit hash> yourfile</tt>.

<p>
The Git equivalent to <tt>hg cat</tt> for just viewing old versions of files is
<tt>git show</tt>, but the command requires the full path from the root
git folder:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git show c7673487763ec2bb374758fb8e7efefa12f16dea:dir1/dir2/myfile
</pre></div>
<p>


<h3>Merging files with Git <a name="bitgit:git:merge"></a></h3>
<p>

The <tt>git pull</tt> command fetches new files from the repository and
tries to perform an automatic merge if there are conflicts between
the local files and the files in the repository.
Git will write a message if the merge is unsuccessful for one or
more files. These files will have to be edited manually.
Merge markers of the type '>>>>>', '======', and '<<<<<' have been
inserted by Git to mark sections of a file where the version in the
repository differ from the local version. You must decide which
lines that are to appear in the final, merged version. When done,
perform <tt>git commit</tt> and the conflicts are resolved.

<p>
Graphical merge tools may ease the process of merging text files.  You
can run <tt>git mergetool --tool=meld</tt> to open the merge tool <tt>meld</tt> for
every file that needs to be merged (or specify the name of a
particular file). Other popular merge tools supported by Git are
<tt>araxis</tt>, <tt>bc3</tt>, <tt>diffuse</tt>, <tt>ecmerge</tt>, <tt>emerge</tt>, <tt>gvimdiff</tt>, <tt>kdiff3</tt>,
<tt>opendiff</tt>, <tt>p4merge</tt>, <tt>tkdiff</tt>, <tt>tortoisemerge</tt>, <tt>vimdiff</tt>, and

Below is a Unix shell script illustrating how to make a global
repository in Git, and how two users clone this repository and
perform edits in parallel. There is one file <tt>myfile</tt> in the
repository.

<h3>Git working style with branching and stashing <a name="bitgit:git:branch:stash"></a></h3>
<p>
Branching and stashing are nice features of Git that allow you to try
out new things without affecting the stable version of your files.
Usually, you extend and modify files quite often and perform a <tt>git
commit</tt> every time you want to record the changes in your local
repository. Imagine that you want to correct a set of errors in some
files and push these corrections immediately.  The problem is that
such a push will also include the latest, unfinished files that you
have committed.

<p>
A better organization of your work would
be to keep the latest, ongoing
developments separate from the more official and stable version
of the files. This is easily achieved by creating a separate branch
where new developments takes place:

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git branch newstuff      <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># create and switch to new branch</span>
<span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># extend and modify files</span>
git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;Modified ... and added a file on ...&#39;</span>

git checkout master      <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># swith back to master</span>
<span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># correct errors</span>
git push origin master

git checkout newstuff    <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># switch to other branch</span>
<span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># continue development work</span>
git commit -am <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;More modifications of ...&#39;</span>  <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># record changes</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
At some point, your new developments are mature enough to be incorporated
in the master branch. This is done via a merge:

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git checkout master
git merge newstuff
</pre></div>
<p>
You no longer need the <tt>newstuff</tt> branch and can delete it:

<p>


<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">git branch -d newstuff
</pre></div>
<p>

It is not possible to switch branches unless you have committed the
files in the current branch. If your work on some files is in a mess,
and you want to change to another branch or fix other files in the
current branch, a
"global" commit affecting all files might be immature.  Then the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing"><tt>git stash</tt></a> command is handy. It
records the state of your files and sets you back to the state of the
last commit in the current branch. With <tt>git stash apply</tt> you get the
files in this branch back to the state when you did the last <tt>git
stash</tt>, or you can use <tt>git stash branch newstuff</tt> to move the edits
since the last commit into a new branch.

<p>
Suppose you have performed some extensive edits in some files and then
you are suddenly interrupted. You need to fix some typos in some
other files, commit the changes, and push. The problem is that many files are
in an unfinished state - in hindsight you realize that those files
should have been modified in a separate branch.
It is not too late to create that branch! First run <tt>git stash</tt>
to get the files back to the
state they were at the last commit. Then run
<tt>git stash branch newstuff</tt> to create a new branch <tt>newstuff</tt> containing
the state of the files when you did the (last) <tt>git stash</tt> command.
Stashing used this way is a convenient technique to
move some immature edits after the last commit out in a new branch for
further experimental work.

<p>
(You can get the stashed files back by <tt>git stash apply</tt>. It is
possible to multiple <tt>git stash</tt> and <tt>git stash apply</tt>
commands. However, it is easy to run into trouble with multiple
stashes, especially if they occur in multiple branches, as it becomes
difficult to recognize which stashes that belong to which branch.  A
good advice is therefore to do <tt>git stash</tt> <em>only once</em> to get back to
a clean state and then move the unfinished messy files to a separate
branch with <tt>git stash branch newstuff</tt>.)

<p>

<b>Remark.</b> A recent <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ShelveExtension">extension module</a> for Mercurial allows stashing for that version control system as well:
<tt>hg shelve --all</tt> is similar for <tt>git stash</tt>, and <tt>hg unshelve</tt>
is similar to <tt>git stash apply</tt>.

<h2>Using Mercurial <a name="bitgit:hg"></a></h2>
<p>

Mac and Linux users will normally work with Mercurial through commands in
a terminal window, which is the emphasized interface described here.
Windows users will prefer to use TortoiseHG. This graphical interface is
mostly self-explanatory, but a brief description appears below.

<p>

<h3>Basic use of TortoiseHG on a Windows machine  <a name="___sec24"></a></h3>
<p>
When you have an account on Bitbucket and have downloaded and installed
TortoiseHG, you are ready to work with Mercurial repositories the
following way.

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Start  <em>Hg workbench</em></li>
 <li> Register your username as your email address: choose <em>File - Settings</em>
   and then <em>Commit</em>.</li>
 <li> Clone a repository: choose <em>File - clone repository</em>. Paste the
   URL of the Bitbucket repo as <em>Source</em> and set
   <em>Destination</em> as some preferred folder on your machine.
   You will be prompted for a password which is the password for your
   Bitbucket account.</li>
 <li> When a file is changed and you want to commit the changes,
   right-click in the Explorer window showing the Mercurial folder
   and choose <em>Commit</em>. Write a comment in the text field to the right
   to document the changes.</li>
 <li> To synchronize your local files with the repository (i.e., to do a
   <tt>push</tt> command), right-click in the Explorer window, choose
   <em>TortoiseHG - Synchronize</em>. You need to provide the password for the
   Bitbucket account.</li>
</ul>

Many prefer to work in Visual Studio with their program files on Windows.
This is easy also when you adopt Bitbucket as repo. Just start VisualStudio,
make a solution and a project, create the desired files, then one can
just right-click with the mouse on the solution, the project, or the
file one wants to commit and choose <em>Commit</em>.

<p>

<h3>Basic Mercurial commands   <a name="___sec25"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Cloning  <a name="___sec26"></a></h4>
<p>
You get started with your project on a new machine or another user
can get started with the project by the command
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/username/my-project
</pre></div>
<p>


<h4>The pull-change-push cycle  <a name="___sec27"></a></h4>
<p>
Your typical working style with the <tt>my-project</tt> project goes as follows.
First you go to the desired folder where this project is stored on
your local computer and make sure
you have the latest versions of the files:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg pull
hg update
</pre></div>
<p>
These commands download the latest versions of the files from
your <tt>bitbucket.org</tt> repository and make them ready for changes on
your computer. The <tt>pull</tt> command requires a functioning Internet
connection.

<p>
You can now edit some files. Maybe you also add, remove, and move some files:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg add filename
hg remove filename
hg rename oldfilename ../somedir/newfilename
</pre></div>
<p>
The removal of a file is physically performed when you do a
<tt>hg commit</tt>. The file is never removed from the repository, only
hidden, so it is easy to get the file and its entire history
back at a later stage.

<p>
After some changes, you have to commit and push the files to the
repository at <tt>bitbucket.org</tt>:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg commit -m <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;Description of changes.&#39;</span>
hg push
</pre></div>
<p>
Note that you cannot easily redo the description so be careful with
the wording. You can run <tt>hg diff</tt> to get a listing of all
the changes you have made since the last commit or pull command.

<p>
The command
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg stat
</pre></div>
<p>
shows the status of the individual files (<tt>M</tt> for modified, <tt>A</tt> for
added, <tt>R</tt> for removed), and you should pay attention to files with a
question mark because these are not tracked in the repository. It is
very easy to forget adding new files so <tt>hg stat</tt> is a useful command
to ensure that all files you want to track have been added to the
repository.

<p>

<h4>Viewing the history of files  <a name="___sec28"></a></h4>
<p>
The power of <tt>hg</tt> and your file repository <tt>bitbucket.org</tt> is that
you can work with the project files on several computers and others can
also contribute to this project. The history of each file is recorded
and anyone can roll back to previous versions, if needed. You can easily see
who did what with the various files.

<p>
For example,
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg annotate -aun myfile
</pre></div>
<p>
lists the various lines in the file <tt>myfile</tt> annotated with the revision
number of the latest change of the line and the name of the user who
performed the change.

<p>
Another command,
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg log -p filename | less
</pre></div>
<p>
lists the history of <tt>filename</tt> in more detail so that you can track
the evolution of this file. Adding the <tt>--follow</tt> option will list the
history also when <tt>filename</tt> had other names.  The history of all
files in a folder is listed by specifying the folder name(s).
No name specification gives the history of the whole repo.

<p>
More compact output from <tt>hg log</tt>, without line differences, is triggered by
the <tt>--stat</tt> option:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg log --stat filename | less   <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># changes in a specific file</span>
hg log --stat | less            <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># changes in the whole repo</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The combination <tt>-p --stat</tt> equips the line differences with an overview
of which files that were changed in each revision.

<p>
If you wonder what has recently happened to a file after updating your
local repository, just run <tt>hg log -p --stat</tt>: the last changes appear
in the beginning of the output.

<p>


<h4>Retrieving old files  <a name="___sec29"></a></h4>
<p>
To restore an old version of a file with name <tt>filename</tt>,
check the file history with
<tt>hg log -p filename</tt> and find the revision number corresponding to the
version of the file you want. Say this revision number is 152.
The command
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg revert -r 152 filename
</pre></div>
<p>
replaces the current version of the file by the old one from revision 152.
Sometimes it is better to store the old version in a separate file:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg cat -r 152 filename &gt; somefile
</pre></div>
<p>
The entire local repo can also be set back:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">hg update -r 152
hg update            <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># go back to the latest version again</span>
</pre></div>
<p>


<h4>Comments on two-level repositories  <a name="___sec30"></a></h4>
<p>
Mercurial has a two-level type of repository: there is global
repository for all users of the <tt>my-project</tt> tree at <tt>bitbucket.org</tt>,
but each user also has a local repository (automatically made). To
update files, one must first pull new files from the global repository
(<tt>pull</tt>) and then update the local repository (<tt>update</tt>), before any
file can be edited. The <tt>hg commit</tt> command saves files in the local
repository. One may run many <tt>hg commit</tt> commands to make a sequence
of corresponding versions of files in the local repository. Finally,
when the local versions are ready to be pushed to the global
repository, one runs the <tt>hg push</tt> command.

<p>
Older version control systems, including Subversion and CVS, have only
a global repository and no local ones.  The advantage of the two-level
repository is that you can change your files locally and keep track of
the changes (by doing <tt>hg commit</tt>) without affecting other users of
the files.  This feature allows you to commit changes to the global
repository only when you feel comfortable with the state of the files.
Nevertheless, if others work actively on the same files as you, it is
generally recommended to push often in order to exchange the latest
version of the files. This strategy may avoid problems with future
merging of files.

It might have happened that others and you have edited the same files
at the same time. How should the edits then be combined?  Often the
<tt>hg update</tt> command is clever enough to merge the changes made by
different users automatically. If not, you have to run an explicit <tt>hg
merge</tt> command.  This command tries to use some merge
program on your computer system to automatically merge files. If this
fails, <tt>hg merge</tt> invokes some graphical tool to help you resolve the
conflict between files.  Example on popular merge programs for this
purpose are <tt>meld</tt>, <tt>xxdiff</tt>, <tt>kdiff3</tt>, and <tt>diffuse</tt>.  You can
specify the merge program, say <tt>xxdiff</tt>, by <tt>hg merge --tool xxdiff</tt>.
How you now proceed is dependent on the particular program. Usually,
for each change you must choose either your new local version of the
text, or your old local version of the text, or the version of the
text pulled from the global repository.  After using the merge program
successfully you must save the merged file and perform an <tt>hg commit</tt>
command on it, and perhaps do an <tt>hg push</tt> to also update the global
repository with the merged file(s).

<p>
Suppose you do not manage to merge using the merge tool. Then you have
to invoke the file, say <tt>myfile</tt> in an editor and do the merge
manually. There will often be lines starting with '<<<<', '=====',
and '>>>>` to mark conflicting texts (<em>merge markers</em>). After removing
these lines and editing the text manually, you must register the conflict
as resolved:

hg commit -m merge myfile

<p>

You can read more about merging files in the <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/a-tour-of-mercurial-merging-work.html">hgbook</a>.
We shall now illustrate the merge problems through an example.
Suppose we have a global repository <tt>tmp_repo</tt>, and two (cloned)
directories <tt>tmp1</tt> and <tt>tmp2</tt>, corresponding to two users, each with
their copy of the global repository.  There is only one file <tt>myfile</tt>
in the repository. We then simulate the two users and perform edits in
parallel. The shell script below simulates the two users and
illustrates the importance of pulling before editing and the need of
merge.

Try to run this <a href="html/_static-bitgithg_merge.sh">file</a> named
<tt>hg_merge.sh</tt> by <tt>sh -x hg_merge.sh</tt>.
To resolve the resulting merge conflict you need to go to the <tt>tmp2</tt>
folder, run <tt>hg merge --tool meld</tt> and use the <tt>meld</tt> tool to
select which text snippets that should make up the final, merged
version. Save and quit <tt>meld</tt> and perform <tt>hg commit -m merge</tt>.  You
can now do <tt>hg push</tt> successfully to update the global repository.

<h2>Appendix: Working with multiple GitHub accounts <a name="appendix:github:multiple:accounts"></a></h2>
<p>
Working against different GitHub accounts is easy if each project you work
with on each account adds you as a collaborator. The term "you" here means your
primary username on GitHub. My strong recommendation is to always check
out a project
using your primary GitHub username.

<p>
Occasionally you want to create a new GitHub account, say for a project <tt>XYZ</tt>.
For such a non-personal account, do <em>not</em> provide an SSH key of any
particular user. The reason is that this user will then get two
GitHub identities, and switching between these identities will require
some special tweakings. Just forget about the SSH key for a project
account and add
collaborators to repos using each collaborators personal GitHub username.

<p>
If you really need to operate the <tt>XYZ</tt> account as a
personal account, you must provide an SSH key that is different from
any other key at any other GitHub account (you will get an error message
if you try to register an already registered SSH key, but it is possible to
get around the error message by providing
an <tt>id_rsa.pub</tt> key on one account and an <tt>id_dsa.pub</tt> on another - that
will cause trouble). A recipe for how to operate multiple GitHub accounts
using multiple identities is provided <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts/">here</a>:
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->

</pre></div>
<p>
To debug which identity that is used when you pull and push to
GitHub accounts, you can first run
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">ssh -Tv git@github.com
</pre></div>
<p>
to see your current identity and which SSH key that was used to identify you.
Typing
<p>

<!-- code typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">ssh-add -l
</pre></div>
<p>
lists all your SSH keys. The shown strings can be compared with the
string in the SSH key field of any GitHub account.
