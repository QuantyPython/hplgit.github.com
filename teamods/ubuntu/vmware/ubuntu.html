<h2 id="___sec2">Why Ubuntu? </h2>

<p>
<b>Unix, Linux, Debian, Ubuntu.</b>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_self">Unix</a>
is an operating system originally developed in 1969. There
have been many Unix implementations or "dialects" around, but during the
last decade, the open source implementation called <em>Linux</em> emerged as the
de facto standard. Another popular implementation, Free BSD Unix,
forms the core of the Mac OS X operating system.  <a href="http://www.ubuntu/com" target="_self">Ubuntu</a> is a user-friendly Linux version much
recommended for students, scientists, and engineers.  Ubuntu is built
on top of <a href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_self">Debian GNU/Linux</a>, which is one
of numerous Linux versions. The great thing about Debian, and
therefore also Ubuntu, is that it comes with almost 30,000 packages
containing all sorts of software.

<p>
<b>Easy installation of packages.</b>
Ubuntu has recently become a very popular operating system
for people working with numerical simulations, simply because
the Debian repository of software is
now by far the richest collection of mathematical software in
ready-made compiled form for easy installation.
Typically, a package <code>X</code>, and all the packages it depends on,
can be installed
by running a one-line command in a terminal window:
<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc sys) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">sudo apt-get install X
</pre></div>
<p>
Mathematical software is often very complex and therefore potentially
difficult to compile, link, and install. One package may also depend
on a dozen of other packages. Getting all this to work is challenging.
On Ubuntu, this challenge is replaced by a one-line command, like the
one above, that takes
a few seconds to run.  There are many other systems similar to Debian
(RedHat, Suse, Fink, MacPorts), but for mathematical software
none of these are as extensive and as regularly updated as
Debian.

<p>
<b>Windows.</b>
On Windows machines, software is usually installed by running an <code>.exe</code> file,
which is very easy. However, each package must be installed
separately, and two packages may depend on different versions of
another package. This may easily cause trouble and is a reason to
adopt Ubuntu.

<p>
<b>Mac.</b>
On Mac, packages are packed in <code>.dmg</code> files which can be run to
install the software and its dependencies. Unfortunately, when working
with mathematical software, one often has to combine packages for which
there are <code>.dmg</code> files with other packages which must be manually
built and installed.  Compiling and linking software on Mac, and
getting it to work properly with packages installed via <code>.dmg</code> files,
quickly requires extensive experience with build
processes on Mac systems.
Unless you have such competence and know very well what
you are doing, we recommend using Ubuntu instead. Software
installation on Ubuntu is just an order of magnitude easier.

<p>
<b>The user gets more power with Ubuntu.</b>
Ubuntu offers a graphical working environment much like those on
Windows and Mac systems.  However, the real power of Unix-based
systems is the terminal window where the user can issue commands to
run applications and work with files and folders. Basic commands can
be combined to form new adanced operations.  Moreover, a set of
commands can be automated in small <em>scripts</em> and thereby increase the
efficiency of computer work dramatically. Many software developers,
scientists, and engineers feel much more productive with Unix commands
than in graphical environments with much tedious clicking.

<h2 id="___sec3">How to run Ubuntu </h2>

<p>
Given a standard Windows or Mac computer, there are two ways of running
Ubuntu:

<ol>
<li> introduce a dual boot solution and boot the machine in Ubuntu,</li>
<li> run Ubuntu in a virtual machine, i.e., in a separate window.</li>
</ol>

The great advantage with the latter method is that you can easily
switch back and forth between Ubuntu and Windows/Mac. This flexibility
comes with an efficiency cost, as the Ubuntu machine running in
parallel with your original operating system requires quite some
memory and computing resources, but this is usually a minor issue on
today's laptops.

<h2 id="___sec4">Dual boot </h2>

<p>
Dual boot means that you have two operating systems on your computer, and
you decide when you start the machine which system to use.
On a Windows machine you can very easily install Ubuntu in a dual
boot fashion using the tool <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi" target="_self">Wubi</a>.
On a Mac we recommend to run Ubuntu (and in addition perhaps Windows) in
a virtual machine.

<h2 id="___sec5">Virtual machines </h2>

<p>
A virtual machine runs another operating system (i.e., another "machine")
in a separate window in your Mac OS X or Windows 7 operating system.
There are three popular products for running virtual machines:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_self">VirtualBox</a> (free)</li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/" target="_self">VMWare Player</a> (free)</li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/" target="_self">VMWare Fusion</a> (commercial)</li>
</ul>

The cost of the latter is at the level of a textbook in science and is
our product of choice since it is known to minimize hardware integration
problems among the three mentioned products.
