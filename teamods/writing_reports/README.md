This directory contains a demonstration of how DocOnce can
be used to generate a wide range of scientific reports with
a vast collection of layouts.

 * `index.html`: the demo
 * `index_with_doconce_commands.html`: extended version of `index.html`
   with all the enabling DocOnce commands are visible
 * `doconce_src`: the DocOnce source for the report (and associated figures
   and computer code)
 * `report_generation`: various scripts needed to produce the reports (just for archival and web access)

Run `make.sh` to copy ready-made reports to this demo directory.
