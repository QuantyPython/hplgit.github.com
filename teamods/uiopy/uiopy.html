<b>Summary.</b> This essay describes why and how we have chosen Python as the language
of choice for teaching scientific computing at the University of Oslo.
The choice of Python has been a great success and is highly
recommended. By teaching students Python from day one, seven Bachelor
programs have taken advantage of this knowledge and reformed classical
science courses by using programming and numerical simulation as
default tool to solve mathematical problems. We have also very positive
experience with standardizing on Ubuntu as computing platform.

<h3>Background for Choosing Python</h3>
<P>
In 1999, I started a course (IN228, renamed to INF3331) about scientific
scripting at the University of Oslo. The purpose was to use a real
scripting language, primarily Perl, to automate execution and archival
of large-scale simulation studies.  Besides dramatically reducing
tedious manual work and ensuring consistent association of results
with input data, such automation is also key to reproducible science
since the script that performs the experiments documents everything
that is needed to reproduce the results. The course also covered
many typical "administrative tasks" that a computational scientist
must deal with, such as interpreting file formats and making user
interfaces of various kind.

<P>
Within a couple of years, we naturally moved from Perl to Python as
the primary scripting language, simply because Python did the same as
Perl just with a more readable syntax that made the programs easier
to go back after six months. Students picked up Python
significantly faster than Perl, and we realized the pedagogical
strengths of the Python language.  I wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Python-Scripting-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642093159/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1340530481&sr=8-2&keywords=langtangen">book</a>
for the course, but the publisher was initially only modestly
interested because Python was still an insignificant language. Our
gut feeling, however, said that Python with time would
gain a significant position in the science and engineering community.
At the time of this writing, this is a fact and the mentioned book
turned out to be a best-seller in its category.
More than 1500 students have been educated in Python through this
course and are now active in industry.

<P>
The course addressed experienced Fortran, C, C++, or Java programmers
and aimed at teaching them the power of a dynamically typed
environment. Early in the 2000s, our research group started using
Python for scientific computations, not only scripting. Our students
used Python (with NumPy, SciPy, and friends) as a MATLAB replacement
and migrated slow parts of the code to Fortran or C++ when needed.  It
stroke us that students should learn about this effective numerical
computing environment as early as possible.

<P>

<P>
<h3>Introductory Computer Programming</h3>
<P>
Most universities ask the computer science department to provide an
introductory programming course, and very often the offer is a
standard Java course. Sometimes the choice is C, C++, or perhaps
something more exotic like Scheme. Beyond the very basics of
programming, the content is usually typical computer science
algorithms rather than numerical algorithms. The result is often that
students for all practical purposes must relearn to program when they
meet programming in science courses, and then the language is usually
MATLAB, Fortran, C, or C++.

<P>
At the University of Oslo, the introductory Java course was not well
synchronized with the needs in science courses and the mentioned
relearning of programming consumed much time when they met a totally
different language and totally different applications of programming
at the end of the bachelor studies.  We therefore decided around 2006
to develop an introductory programming course that could lay a firm
foundation for continued programming in all later courses where the
teaching would benefit from integrating numerical simulations. A part
of the idea was to teach programming in the context of relevant
algorithms like numerical integration, differentiation, solution of
differential equations, and Monte Carlo simulation.

<P>
The introductory programming course was scheduled for the very first
semester, meaning that the students would learn to program and use the
computer to solve mathematical problems from day one.  But what should
be the language of choice? MATLAB or C++ were obvious candidates
because of their popularity. These two languages are, however, very
different in nature, and it is not natural to integrate them in a course.
Python, on the other hand, can be used for MATLAB-style
programming and object-oriented or generative C++-style programming. In this
way Python provides a natural glue between different programming
styles.  We also knew that Python was much easier to use and teach
than C++.  The most convincing argument was, nevertheless, that Python
may act as a MATLAB replacement for students and professors, doing the
same things as MATLAB, and for free, but with a much more powerful
programming language at disposal.
<!-- (Since I am on an 80% leave from -->
<!-- the University, I am not qualified for MathWorks' academic discount, -->
<!-- and my MATLAB license hence costs twice as much as my laptop.) -->

<P>
Again I wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642183654/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340530481&sr=8-1&keywords=langtangen">book</a> for the introductory programming course, this time
addressing newcomers to programming and concentrating the examples on
numerical computing. Needless to say, there were many skeptics:
Python was of marginal interest to scientific computing, Python was
a bad first language, mixing programming and mathematics is inferior
to first mastering calculus and Java separately, etc. etc.

<P>
<!-- People have constantly reminded me about the possibly marginal interest -->
<!-- Python will obtain in science, and that going for the established, popular -->
<!-- tools (MATLAB or C++) would be more relevant for the studentsa and also -->
<!-- sell more books. -->

<P>
The <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF1100/index-eng.xml">course</a> is
now a huge success. Since 2007, more than 1000 students have passed
the exam and used the programming technology to solve mathematical
problems in about 20 other courses in the Bachelor programs at the
University of Oslo. The introduction of programming and numerical
simulation in all these other courses was a huge undertaking known as
the <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/">Computing in Science Education project</a>. This project
has attracted worldwide attention as it represents a long-awaited
reform of the science education.  The idea is trivial: let programming
and computer simulations change the curriculum! However, the
implementation among professors is extremely demanding most
places. The fortunate situation in Oslo is that professors across
disciplines have managed to collaborate on how programming and
simulation can be integrated in classical courses and used to replace
the classical strong attention on complicated and specialized
mathematical techniques for very simplified physical problems.
Recently, the Computing in Science Education project has been
acknowledged by the University and the government in Norway through
prestigious <a href="http://simula.no/news/computing-in-science-education-receives-learning-environment-award">awards</a>
and generous funding.  The ideas are being implemented at other
Norwegian colleges and universities as well as at several institutions
abroad.

<h3>Impact of Teaching Python</h3>
<P>
The world is changed only when people do new things. When students
learn Python, they bring this knowledge to later courses and then to
industry. Their knowledge automatically creates a demand for using the
tools they prefer.  Many companies in the Oslo region that apply
Python today discovered the language through new employees who had
picked up Python in the scripting course. Similarly, students create
Python examples and projects in other courses and thereby attract
attention to the tool and its applications.

<P>
The science education at the University of Oslo puts much emphasis on
learning other languages, in particular MATLAB, R, C, C++, and
Fortran.  We teach (a subset of) Python in a way that eases the
transition to and from MATLAB.  For high performance we emphasize
reusing Fortran and C libraries from Python or migrating slow Python
code to compiled languages.  Our experience shows that users who gain
a good knowledge of Python tend to prefer that language and do as much
as possible in Python before the quest for high performance demands
migration of (usually small) parts of the code to a compiled language.
It seems that many students and professors, when their knowledge of
Python is at the level of their MATLAB skills, steadily drift to do
most of their work in Python. This is a sign of a kind of gravity
force, which we believe is rooted in Python's syntax, powerful
expressiveness, and rich set of libraries.

<P>
The described trend among students and professors are also found in
industry: Python steadily eats of the MATLAB market because people find
the language stronger and more convenient. Our efforts in teaching and
professional use of Python contribute to the observed exponential
growth.  MATLAB has in my opinion been the single most important
invention in scientific computing, and Python represents a kind of
"free MATLAB" with a more powerful programming language.

<P>

<P>
<h3>How We Teach Python Computing</h3>
<P>
As mentioned, we start day one when the 19-year old new students
arrive at the University. About 300 students enter courses on classical
calculus, numerical calculus, and programming of the latter. The
programming course covers basic MATLAB-style procedural programming in
the first half of the fall semester, while the second half is spent on
class programming (classes and object-oriented programming were
invented in Oslo so we have no other choice!), statistical
simulations, and ordinary differential equations. The final
project is to create a flexible, object-oriented toolbox for
studying nonlinear vibration problems described by
the standard model
$$ m \ddot x + f(\dot x) + s(x) = F(t) $$

<P>
Many reviews of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642183654/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340530481&sr=8-1&keywords=langtangen">course book</a>
claim that the book is quite advanced and may fit the graduate
level. However, most of the book is in fact covered the very first
semester in Oslo. This works well and the course has received
excellent student critiques.  Scientists usually think of Monte Carlo
simulation and nonlinear differential equations as advanced topics,
not belonging to first semester courses, but the methods and their
applications can be exposed in very intuitive ways suitable for
newbies.  At least the students can train their programming skills on
such problems and be able to produce solutions to what many
traditionally think of as advanced problems.  However, a deeper
understanding of what they actually do needs to wait until they master
a broader set of courses.

<P>
Many fear to introduce programming and simulation in courses because
there are so many technical details. For example, how shall students
install Python and 30 software packages on their personal
laptops? Elaborating a bit on this problem setting quickly scares any teacher.
We have found a solution that has proven to be successful over the last
four years: <em>force all students to use Ubuntu</em> and provide support for
Ubuntu only!

<P>
Mac users typically run Ubuntu in a virtual machine (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, or preferably, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player">VMWare Player</a> or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html/">VMWare Fusion</a>), while Windows
users can run a virtual machine or have a dual boot.  The <a href="http://wubi-installer.org">Wubi</a> software makes installing the dual boot
solution very easy.  On Ubuntu we have one package (<tt>python-scitools</tt>)
that installs everything the students need in one command. Later courses can
just provide a one-line command with their needs for additional packages.

<P>
There are several reasons why we dare to force the use of Ubuntu:

<P>

<ol>
<li> Ubuntu (or more precisely, Debian Linux) has the largest collection of mathematical software today.
<li> Mathematical software is often complex to install, but on Ubuntu this is done by a one-line command.
<li> Ubuntu is easier for students to operate than other Linux/Unix systems (especially Mac OS X).
<li> Ubuntu's graphical interface is very similar to Windows or Mac OS X.
<li> Ubuntu (or more precisely, Unix/Linux) provides more powerful support for programming in general than Windows or Mac (in my opinion).
</ol>

Soon we expect supercomputing in the cloud to be a reality. Then one can
just upload the Ubuntu image (running in a virtual machine) to the
cloud service and avoid tedious installation processes. By archiving the
image along with scientific results, one can at any time in the future
rerun simulations - the complete operating system, all the needed
software, and all data reside in the image.

<P>
So far, I have not heard one single negative comment that we support
Ubuntu only. When we tried to support Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac,
there were a lot of complaints from students that they did not have
access to the right software and that technical problems with
computers stole too much attention. These complaints have simply
disappeared with the standardization on Ubuntu.  This is very
surprising to me (and most others), but a fact.
