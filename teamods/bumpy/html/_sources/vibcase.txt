Physical Problem
----------------

The task is to make a simulation program that can predict how a (simple)
mechanical system oscillates in response to environmental forces.
Introducing :math:`u(t)` as some displacement of the system at time :math:`t`,
application of Newton's second law of motion to such a mechanical system often
results in the following type of equation for :math:`u`:


.. math::
   :label: bumpy:eq1
        
        mu''(t) + bu'(t) + f(u) = F(t),
        
        

The prime, as in :math:`u'(t)`, denotes differentiation with respect to time.
Furthermore, :math:`m` is the mass of the system, :math:`b` is a coefficient related to
the damping of the system, :math:`f(u)` represents a restoring force, such as
a spring, and :math:`F(t)` are the external environmental forces on the system.
Equation :eq:`bumpy:eq1` must be accompanied by two initial conditions
for :math:`u(0)` and :math:`u'(0)`.
The values of these have no effect on the
steady state behavior of :math:`u(t)` for large values of :math:`t`, since this
behavior is determined by the force :math:`F(t)` and the system
parameters :math:`m`, :math:`b`, and :math:`f(u)`. Therefore, we simply choose
:math:`u(0)=I` and :math:`u'(0)=0`.
The input data consists of :math:`m`, :math:`b`, :math:`f(u)`, :math:`F(t)`,
:math:`u(0)`, and :math:`u'(0)`, while the :math:`u(t)` is the unknown quantity to be
computed.

One example where the model above has relevance, is the vertical
vibration of a vehicle in response to a bumpy road. Let :math:`h(x)` be the
height of the road at some coordinate :math:`x` along the road.  When
driving along this road with constant velocity :math:`v`, the vehicle is
moved up and down in time according to :math:`h(vt)`, resulting in an
external vertical force :math:`F(t)=-mh''(vt)v^2`. We assume that the
vehicle has springs and dampers that here are modeled as :math:`bu'`
(damper) and :math:`f(s)=ku` (spring), with given damping parameter :math:`b` and
spring constant :math:`k`. The unknown :math:`u(t)` is the vertical displacement
of the vehicle relative to the road. Figure :ref:`bumpy:fig1`
illustrates the situation.


.. _bumpy:fig1:

.. figure:: fig-bumpy/vehicle2.png
   :width: 600

   *Vehicle on a bumpy road*


Another example regards the vertical shaking of a building due to
earthquake-induced movement of the ground. If the vertical displacement of the
ground is recorded as a function :math:`d(t)`, this results in a
vertical force :math:`F(t)=-md''(t)`. The soil foundation acts as a
spring and damper on the building, modeled through the damping parameter
:math:`b` and normally a linear spring term :math:`f(u)=ku`.

In both cases we drop the effect of gravity, which is just a constant
compression of the spring.

.. wing, riser


Our task is to compute and analyse the vertical :math:`u(t)` vibrations
of a vehicle, given the shape :math:`h(x)` of the road and some velocity :math:`v`.


Numerical Model and Implementation
----------------------------------

Using a standard second-order finite difference method for :eq:`bumpy:eq1`
gives rise to an algorithm that computes an approximation :math:`u^n` to
:math:`u(t_n)` at time points :math:`t_n=n\Delta t`, :math:`n=1,2,\ldots`, where :math:`\Delta t`
is a (small) time interval. For example, if :math:`\Delta t = 0.1`, we
find approximations :math:`u^1` to :math:`u` at :math:`t=0.1`, :math:`u^2` at :math:`t=0.2`, :math:`u^3`
to :math:`t=0.3`, and so forth. Mathematically, the algorithm can be
written as


.. math::
        
        u^0 &= 0,\\
        u^1 &= u^0 - \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}\left( f(u^0) - F(t_0)\right),\\
        u^n &= \left(
        \left(\frac{1}{2}b\Delta t - m\right)u^{n-1} + 2mu^n - \Delta t^2\left(
        f(u^n) - F(t_n)\right)\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}b\Delta t + m\right)^{-1},\
        n=2,3,\ldots
        


The implementation of the computational algorithm can make use
of an array ``u`` to represent :math:`u^n` as ``u[n]``. The force :math:`F(t_n)` is
assumed to be available as an array element ``F[n]``. The following
Python function computes ``u`` given  an array ``t``
with time points :math:`t_0,t_1,\ldots`,
the initial displacement ``I``, mass ``m``, damping parameter ``b``,
restoring force ``f(u)``, environmental forces ``F`` as an array
(corresponding to ``t``).

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        
        def forced_vibrations(t, I, m, b, f, F):
            """
            Solve a vibrating system problem m*u'' + b*u' + f(u) = F(t)
            with u(0)=I and u'(0)=0, for time values in the array t,
            by a finite difference method. Return u.
            u is an array of the same size as the array F and t.
            """
            dt = t[1] - t[0]           # time step
            N = t.size - 1             # no of time intervals
            u = np.zeros(N+1)
        
            u[0] = I
            u[1] = u[0] + (dt**2/(2*m))*(F[0] - f(u[0]))
        
            for n in range(1, N):
                u[n+1] = ((b/2*dt - m)*u[n-1] + 2*m*u[n] \
                          - dt**2*(f(u[n]) - F[n]))/(b/2*dt + m)
            return u


Dissection of the Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functions in Python start with ``def``, followed by the function name and
the list of input objects separated by comma. The function body is
indented, and the first non-indented line signifies the end of the function
body block. The string, enclosed in triple double-quotes, right after
the function definition, is a *doc string* used for documenting the
function. Various tools can extract function definitions and doc strings
to automatically produced manuals.

Array functionality is offered by
the ``numpy`` packaged, here imported under the nickname ``np``.
This package contains MATLAB-like functionality. It is quite common
to prefix a MATLAB-like function such as ``zeros`` by ``np`` (``np.zeros``),
but one can also perform

.. code-block:: py


        from numpy import *

and then write just ``zeros`` without any prefix. The advantage is that
the code closely  resembles similar MATLAB code.

The total number of elements in an array ``t`` is obtained by ``t.size``.
One could also use ``len(t)``, but for multi-dimensional arrays ``len``
just gives the number of elements corresponding to the first index
(number of rows in a matrix).

Arrays are indexed by square brackets, and indices always start at 0.
For/do loops in Python are more general than those in Fortran, C, C++,
and Java, as one can loop over the any set of objects with the
syntax ``for element in some_set``. In numerical code, it is common
to loop over array indices, i.e., a set of integers. Such a set
is produced by ``range(start, stop, increment)``, which returns a
list of integers ``start, start+increment, start+2*increment``, and so on,
up to *but not including* ``stop``. Writing just ``range(stop)`` means
``range(0, stop, 1)``. The particular call ``range(1, N)`` used in the code
above results in the integer sequence ``1``, ``2``, ..., ``N-1``.

Every variable in Python is an object. In particular, the ``f`` function
above is a function object, transferred to the function as any other
object, and called as any other function. Transferring a function as
argument to another function is therefore simpler and cleaner in Python
than in, e.g., C, C++, Java, and C#.


The Force =
-----------

Considering the application where the present mathematical model describes
the vibrations of a vehicle driving along a bumpy road, we need
to establish the force array ``F`` from the shape of the road :math:`h(x)`.
Various shapes are
available as a file with web address `<http://hplbit.bitbucket.org/data/bumpy/bumpy.dat.gz>`_. The Python functionality for downloading this ``gzip``
compressed file as a local file ``bumpy.dat.gz``
and reading it into a ``numpy`` array goes as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        filename = 'bumpy.dat.gz'
        url = 'http://hplbit.bitbucket.org/data/bumpy/bumpy.dat.gz'
        import urllib
        urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename)
        h_data = np.loadtxt(filename)     # read numpy array from file


.. It may happen that the URL is wrong or that the Internet connection is

.. down, resulting in a ``ValueError`` exception in ``np.loadtxt``.

.. This potential error can be handled in a ``try``-`except` construction:


The ``h_data`` object is a rectangular ``numpy`` array where the first
column contains the :math:`x` coordinates along the road and the next columns
contain various road shapes :math:`h(x)`. We can extract the :math:`x` data and
redefine ``h_data`` to contain solely the :math:`h(x)` shapes:

.. code-block:: python

        x = h_data[0,:]                # 1st column: x coordinates
        h_data = h_data[1:,:]          # other columns: h shapes

In general, the syntax ``a[s:t:i,2]`` gives a view (not a copy) to the part of
the array ``a`` where the first index goes from ``s`` to ``t``,
*but not including* the ``t`` value, in increments of ``i``, and the
second index is fixed at 2. Just writing ``:`` for an index means all
legal values of this index.

Given :math:`h(x)`, the corresponding acceleration :math:`a(t)` needed in the
force :math:`F(t)=-ma(t)`, follows from :math:`a(t)=h''(vt)v^2`, where :math:`v` is
the velocity of the vehicle. The compuation may utilize a finite
difference approximation for the second-order derivative and
be encapsulated in a Python function:

.. code-block:: python

        def acceleration(h, x, v):
            # Compute 2nd-order derivative of h
            d2h = np.zeros(h.size)
            dx = x[1] - x[0]
            for i in range(1, h.size-1, 1):
                d2h[i] = (h[i-1] - 2*h[i] + h[i+1])/dx**2
            # Extraplolate end values from first interior value
            d2h[0] = d2h[1]
            d2h[-1] = d2h[-2]
            a = d2h*v**2
            return a

Note that here, ``h`` is a one-dimensional array containing the :math:`h(x)`
values corresponding to a given coordinate array ``x``. Also note that
we simply set :math:`h''(x)` at the end points equal to :math:`h''(x)` at the
closest interior point.

We use in this example a linear spring function :math:`f(u)`,

.. code-block:: python

        def f(u):
            return k*u

Here, ``u`` is a *local variable*,
which lives just inside in the function,
while ``k`` is a *global variable*, which must be initialized outside
the function prior to calling ``f``.

Parameters can be set as :math:`m=60` kg, :math:`v=5` m/s, :math:`k=60` N/m,
and :math:`b=80` Ns/m.
This choice corresponds to a velocity of 18 km/h and a mass of 60 kg, i.e.,
bicycle conditions.

For each shape :math:`h(x)` we want to compute the corresponding
vertical displacement :math:`u(t)` using the mathematical model :eq:`bumpy:eq1`.
This can be accomplished by looping over the columns of ``h_data`` and
calling ``forced_vibrations`` for each column, i.e., each realization of
the force :math:`F`.
The major arrays from the computations
are collected in a list ``data``. The two first elements in
``data`` are ``x`` and ``t``. The next elements are
3-lists ``[h, a, u]`` for each road shape.
Note that some elements in ``data`` are arrays while others are list of
arrays. This composition is convenient when analyzing and visualizing
key quantities in the problem.

The computations of ``u`` for each road shape can be done as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        data = [x, t]      # key input and output data (arrays)
        for i in range(h_data.shape[0]):
            h = h_data[i,:]            # extract a column
            a = acceleration(h, x, v)
            u = forced_vibrations(t=t, I=0, m=m, b=2000, f=f, F=-m*a)
            data.append([h, a, u])


The code above is naturally implemented as a Python function.
This function can take the most important physical parameters of the problem
as input, along with information about the file with road shapes.
We allow for defining road shapes either through a file on a web site
or a local file.

.. code-block:: python

        def solve(url=None, m=60, b=80, k=60, v=5):

                data.append([h, a, u])
            return data

Note that function arguments can be given default values (known as
*keyword arguments* in Python). Python has a lot of operating
system functionality, such as
checking if a file, directory, or link exist, creating or
removing files and directories, running stand-alone applications, etc.

Since the roads have a quite noise shape, the force :math:`F=-ma` looks
very noise, while the response :math:`u(t)` to this excitation is
significantly less noisy,
see Figure :ref:`bumpy:fig4` for an example.
It may be useful to compute the root mean square value of the various
realizations of :math:`u(t)` and add this array to the ``data`` list of input
and output data in the problem:

.. code-block:: python

        def rms(data):
            t = data[1]
            u_rms = np.zeros(t.size)  # for accumulating the rms value
            for h, a, u in data[2:]:  # loop over results
                u_rms += u**2
            u_rms = np.sqrt(u_rms/u_rms.size)
            data.append(u_rms)
            return data

Observe here the ``for`` loop where three variables (``h``, ``a``, and ``u``)
are set equal to the three arrays in each element of the sublist
``data[2:]``. We only need the ``u`` array for the computation. An alternative
loop would be to have one loop variable for each list element and
get ``u`` as the 3rd element of each list element:

.. code-block:: python

            for res in data[2:]:
                u = res[2]         # res is [h,a,u]
                ...



.. index:: pickling


After calling

.. code-block:: python

        road_url = 'http://hplbit.bitbucket.org/data/bumpy/bumpy.dat.gz'
        data = solve(url=road_url,
                     m=60, b=200, k=60, v=6)
        data = rms(data)

the ``data`` array contains single arrays and triplets of arrays,

.. code-block:: python

        [x, t, [h,a,u], [h,a,u], ..., [h,a,u], u_rms]

This list, or any Python object, can be stored on file for later
retrieval of the results, using the *pickling* functionality
in Python:

.. code-block:: py


        import cPickle
        outfile = open('bumpy.res', 'w')
        cPickle.dump(data, outfile)
        outfile.close()


.. joblib!!


User Input
----------

We can in this example easily set the input data directly in
the program, e.g., in the call to the ``solve`` function, as
demonstrated above. However, most users will find it more
convenient to set parameters through a user interface rather
than editing the source code directly.


Positional Command-Line Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest, and often also the most effective, type of
user interface is to use the command line. Suppose :math:`m`, :math:`k`,
and :math:`v`, as well as the URL or filename for the road shapes,
are fixed parameters and that the user is allowed to vary
:math:`b` only. Then it is convenient, both for the user and
the programmer, to specify :math:`b` as the first command-line
argument to the program. If the name of the program file
is ``bumpy.py`` and :math:`b=10` is desired, we can write

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python bumpy.py 10

The corresponding code in the program for setting input data
and extract the user-given value of :math:`b` reads

.. code-block:: python

        def prepare_input():
            url = 'http://hplbit.bitbucket.org/data/bumpy/bumpy.dat.gz'
            m = 60
            k = 60
            v = 5
            try:
                b = float(sys.argv[1])
            except IndexError:
                b = 80  # default
            return url, m, b, k, v

The command-line arguments are available as strings in the
list ``sys.argv``, from the element with index 1 and onward.
The first command-line argument ``sys.argv[1]`` is a string
so it must be converted to a ``float`` object (representing
real number) prior to computations. If the command-line
argument is missing, ``sys.argv[1]`` is illegal indexing
and the ``IndexError`` exception is raised. We can test for this
error and provide a default value. Without the ``try``-`except`
construction, the program will abort with an error message
if no command-line argument is given.

Option-Value Pairs on the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Letting the user set many parameters on the command line is most
conveniently done by allowing option-value pairs, e.g.,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python bumpy.py --m 40 --b 280

All parameters have a default value which can be overrided on
the command line by providing the string (option) ``--name``, where
``name`` is the name of the parameter, followed by the desired value of
the parameter. Implementation of option-value input is
most easily carried out using Python's ``argparse`` module.
The recipe goes as follows.

.. code-block:: python

        def command_line_options():
            import argparse
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
            parser.add_argument('--m', '--mass', type=float,

            url = args.roadfile
            return url, m, b, k, v

We may offer two options for each parameter, one reflecting the
mathematical symbol (like ``--v``) and one more descriptive text
(like ``--velocity-``).

The file `<_static-bumpy/bumpy.py>`_ contains the complete code
for downloading road shapes and solving the problem with aid of the
code snippets above.

Visual Exploration
------------------

This section explains how to load the data from the computation, stored
as a pickled list in the file ``bumpy.res``, into various arrays, and how
to visualize these arrays. We want to produce the following plots:

 * the root mean square value of :math:`u(t)`, to see the typical amplitudes

 * the spectrum of :math:`u(t)`, for :math:`t>t_s` (using FFT) to see which frequencies
   that dominate in the signal

 * for each road shape, a plot of :math:`h(x)`, :math:`a(t)`, and :math:`u(t)`, for
   :math:`t\geq t_s`

We use Matplotlib's ``pylab`` module for curve plotting since it provides
a syntax very close to that of MATLAB, which is well known by many readers.

.. code-block:: python

        from matplotlib.pylab import *

This import also perform as ``from numpy import *`` such that we have access
to all the array functionality too.

Loading the computational data from file back to a list ``data`` is done
by

.. code-block:: python

        import cPickle
        outfile = open('bumpy.res', 'r')
        data = cPickle.load(outfile)
        outfile.close()
        
        x, t = data[0:2]
        u_rms = data[-1]

The remaining data, ``data[2:-1]``, contains all the 3-lists ``[h, a, u]``
from the computations in the function ``forced_vibrations``.

Since now we concentrate on the part :math:`t\geq t_s` of the data, we
can grab the corresponding parts of the arrays in the following way,
using boolean arrays as indices:

.. code-block:: python

        indices = t >= t_s   # True/False boolean array
        t = t[indices]       # fetch the part of t for which t > t_s
        x = x[indices]       # fetch the part of x for which t > t_s

Indexing by a boolean array extracts all the elements corresponding to
the ``True`` elements in the index array.

Plotting the root mean square value array ``u_rms`` for ``t >= t_s`` is now done by

.. code-block:: python

        figure()
        u_rms = u_rms[indices]
        plot(t, u_rms)
        legend(['u'])
        xlabel('t')
        title('Root mean square value of u(t) functions')

Figure :ref:`bumpy:fig3` shows the result.

   *Root mean square of displacement*



The spectrum of a :math:`u(t)` function (represented through the arrays ``u``
and ``t``) can be computed by the Python function

.. code-block:: python

        def frequency_analysis(u, t):
            A = fft(u)
            A = 2*A
            dt = t[1] - t[0]
            N = t.size
            freq = arange(N/2, dtype=float)/N/dt
            A = abs(A[0:freq.size])/N
            # Remove small high frequency part
            tol = 0.05*A.max()
            for i in xrange(len(A)-1, 0, -1):
                if A[i] > tol:
                    break
            return freq[:i+1], A[:i+1]

Note here that we truncate that last part of the spectrum where the
amplitudes are small (this usually gives a plot that is easier to inspect).

In the present case, we utilize the ``frequency_analysis`` through

.. code-block:: python

        figure()
        u = data[3][2][indices]  # 2nd realization of u
        f, A = frequency_analysis(u, t)
        plot(f, A)
        title('Spectrum of u')

Note the list look-up ``data[3][2][indices]``: the element with index
3 contains the 2nd 3-list ``[h, a, u]``, and the element with index 2
in this 3-list is the ``u`` array, in which we seek the part where
:math:`t\geq t_s`, here corresponding to the ``True`` indices in the boolean
array ``indices``.

Figure :ref:`bumpy:fig2` shows the amplitudes and that the
dominating frequency is 1 Hz.

   *Spectrum of displacement*


Finally, we can run through all the 3-lists ``[h, a, u]`` and plot
these arrays:

.. code-block:: python

        case_counter = 0
        for h, a, u in data[2:-1]:
            h = h[indices]
            a = a[indices]
            u = u[indices]
        
            figure()
            subplot(3, 1, 1)
            plot(x, h, 'g-')
            legend(['h %d' % case_counter])
            hmax = (abs(h.max()) + abs(h.min()))/2
            axis([x[0], x[-1], -hmax*5, hmax*5])
            xlabel('distance'); ylabel('height')
        
            subplot(3, 1, 2)
            plot(t, a)
            legend(['a %d' % case_counter])
            xlabel('t'); ylabel('acceleration')
        
            subplot(3, 1, 3)
            plot(t, u, 'r-')
            legend(['u %d' % case_counter])
            xlabel('t'); ylabel('displacement')
            savefig('tmp%d.png' % case_counter)
            case_counter += 1


.. A word about what happens to the ``h`` (or ``a`` or ``u``) variable might

.. illustrate much about dynamic typing in Python. In the loop, ``h`` is

.. set equal to an

If all the plot commands above are placed in a file, as in
`<_static-bumpy/explore.py>`_, a final ``show()`` call is needed to show the
plots on the screen. On the other hand, the commands are usually
more conveniently performed in an interactive Python shell, preferably
IPython.
