 * The evaluator has already noticed this group as good
 * You have an impressive volume of production

   proceedings papers, and talks to the scientific eco system
 * You solve really important problems
 * You publish in leading journals
 * Now: You have impressive citation counts
 * You are visible (keynotes, community positions, big network)
 * Much is done if you are known for one thing<linebreak>
