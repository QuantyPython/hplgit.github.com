<h1>We chose Python for learning computer programming<a class="headerlink" href="#we-chose-python-for-learning-computer-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Most universities buy an introductory programming course from their
computer science department.  Very often the offer is a standard Java
course.  Exceptionally the choice is C, C++, or perhaps something more
exotic like Scheme. The primary examples
are frequently math-free toy problems (&#8220;class Dog is a subclass of class
Animal, and class Dog has four instances of class Leg&#8221;).
Our experience is that the combination of programming and mathematical
application is challenging and requires much training.
Without such training, the students must usually
relearn to program when they meet a need for programming in science
courses with languages like MATLAB, Fortran, C, or C++.</p>
<p>At the University of Oslo, the introductory Java course was free of
any mathematics and not synchronized with the needs in later science
courses. The mentioned relearning of programming consumed much time
when they met a totally different language and totally different
applications of programming at the end of the bachelor studies.  We
therefore decided around 2006 to develop an introductory programming
course that could lay a firm foundation for continued programming in
all later courses that could benefit from integrating numerical
simulations. We would therefore teach programming in the context of
relevant algorithms like numerical integration, differentiation,
solution of differential equations, and Monte Carlo simulation.</p>
<p>The introductory programming course was scheduled for the very first
semester, meaning that the students would learn to program and use the
computer to solve mathematical problems from day one.  But what should
be the language of choice? MATLAB or C++ were obvious candidates
because of their popularity. These two languages are, however, very
different in nature, and it is not natural to integrate them in a course.
Python, on the other hand, can be used for MATLAB-style
programming and object-oriented or generative C++-style programming. In this
way Python provides a natural glue between different programming
styles.  We also knew that Python was much easier to use and teach
than C++.  The most convincing argument was, nevertheless, that Python
may act as a MATLAB replacement for students and professors, doing the
same things as MATLAB, and for free, but with a much more powerful
programming language at disposal.</p>
<p>Again I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://goo.gl/SWEQlz">book</a>
for the introductory programming course, this time addressing
newcomers to programming and concentrating the examples on numerical
computing. Needless to say, there were many skeptics: Python was of
marginal interest to scientific computing, Python was a bad first
language because of its dynamic typing, mixing programming and
mathematics is inferior to first mastering calculus and Java
separately - and the arguments went on and on to avoid radical changes.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF1100/index-eng.xml">course</a> is
now a huge success, and the book is a best-seller in its
category. Since 2007, more than 1500 students have passed the exam and
used the programming technology to solve mathematical problems in
about 20 other courses in the Bachelor programs at the University of
Oslo. The introduction of programming and numerical simulation in all
these other courses was a huge undertaking known as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/">Computing in
Science Education project</a>. This project
has attracted worldwide attention as it represents a long-awaited
reform of the science education.  The idea is trivial: let programming
and computer simulations change the curriculum! However, the
implementation among professors is extremely demanding most
places. The fortunate situation in Oslo is that professors across
disciplines have managed to collaborate on how programming and
simulation can be integrated in classical courses and used to replace
the classical strong attention on complicated and specialized
mathematical techniques for very simplified physical problems.
Recently, the Computing in Science Education project has been
acknowledged by the University and the government in Norway through
prestigious <a class="reference external" href="http://simula.no/news/computing-in-science-education-receives-learning-environment-award">awards</a>
and generous funding.  The ideas are being implemented at other
Norwegian colleges and universities as well as at several institutions
abroad.</p>
