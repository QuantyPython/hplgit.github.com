<h2>We started with a course on Python scripting  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>

In 1999, I started a course (IN228, renamed to INF3331) about scientific
scripting at the University of Oslo. The purpose was to use a real
scripting language, primarily Perl, to do all the administrative
computer work associated with scientific investigations. During the 90s
we had tried to throw the "Camel Book" for Perl4 and the "Unix Power Tools"
book at people, but few (if any) understood why and how they should apply
such tools to their scientific work.

<p>
Within a couple of years, we naturally moved from Perl to Python as
the primary scripting language, because Python did the same as Perl,
but with a more readable syntax and hence easier maintenance.
Students picked up Python significantly faster than Perl, and we
started realizing the pedagogical strengths of the Python language.  I
wrote a <a href="http://goo.gl/q8tM7D" target="_self">book</a>
for the course, but the publisher was initially only modestly
interested because the market was considered too small.
Our gut feeling, however, told that scripting with Python with
time would gain a significant position in the scientific computing
community.  At the time of this writing,
this is a fact. Over 2000 students have completed the course, and the
book has been very popular world wide.

<p>
The course addressed experienced Fortran, C, C++, or Java programmers
and aimed at teaching them the power of a dynamically typed
environment. Early in the 2000s, our research group started using
Python for scientific computations, not only scripting. Our students
used Python (with NumPy, SciPy, and friends) as a MATLAB replacement
and migrated slow parts of the code to Fortran or C++ when needed.  It
stroke us that students should learn about this effective numerical
computing environment as early as possible.
