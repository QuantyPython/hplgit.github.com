__Summary.__
This essay explains why and how we have chosen Python as the language
of choice for teaching scientific computing at the University of Oslo.
By teaching students Python and numerics from day one, various bachelor
programs have taken advantage of this knowledge and reformed classical
science courses by using programming and numerical simulation
to solve mathematical problems. We have learned several
lessons:

  * The choice of Python as a teaching language for scientific computing
    has been a great success and is highly recommended.
  * Python provides a natural, continuous glue between MATLAB-style
    "flat programs", procedural programming, object-oriented programming,
    generative programming, and even functional programming.
  * It is possible to treat quite advanced problems very early in
    the studies. For example, at the end of the first semester our students
    implement an object-oriented toolbox for
    solving a wide class of nonlinear vibration problems (!).
  * Replacing classical mathematical solution techniques by
    programming and numerical simulation in science courses is
    indeed challenging, but possible and natural. The experience is very
    positive and such reforms are strongly encouraged.
  * Students come with all sorts of laptops. Force everyone to use
    Ubuntu as this minimizes the technical hassle with
    installing complicated mathematical software.

===== We started with a course on Python scripting =====

In 1999, I started a course (IN228, renamed to INF3331) about scientific
scripting at the University of Oslo. The purpose was to use a real
scripting language, primarily Perl, to do all the administrative
computer work associated with scientific investigations. During the 90s
we had tried to throw the "Camel Book" for Perl4 and the "Unix Power Tools"
book at people, but few (if any) understood why and how they should apply
such tools.

Within a couple of years, we naturally moved from Perl to Python as
the primary scripting language, because Python did the same as Perl,
but with a more readable syntax and hence easier maintenance.
Students picked up Python significantly faster than Perl, and we
started realizing the pedagogical strengths of the Python language.  I
wrote a "book":
"http://www.amazon.com/Python-Scripting-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642093159/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1340530481&sr=8-2&keywords=langtangen"
for the course, but the publisher was initially only modestly
interested because the market was considered too small.
Our gut feeling, however, told that scripting with Python with
time would gain a significant position in the scientific computing
community.  At the time of this writing,
this is a fact. Over 1500 students have completed the course, and the
book has been very popular world wide.

The course addressed experienced Fortran, C, C++, or Java programmers
and aimed at teaching them the power of a dynamically typed
environment. Early in the 2000s, our research group started using
Python for scientific computations, not only scripting. Our students
used Python (with NumPy, SciPy, and friends) as a MATLAB replacement
and migrated slow parts of the code to Fortran or C++ when needed.  It
stroke us that students should learn about this effective numerical
computing environment as early as possible.

===== We chose Python for learning computer programming =====

Most universities buy an introductory programming course from their
computer science department.  Very often the offer is a standard Java
course.  Exceptionally the choice is C, C++, or perhaps something more
exotic like Scheme. Beyond the very basics of programming, the content
is usually typical computer science algorithms rather than numerical
algorithms. The result is often that students for all practical
purposes must relearn to program when they meet programming in science
courses, and then the language is usually MATLAB, Fortran, C, or C++.

At the University of Oslo, the introductory Java course was free of
any mathematics and not synchronized with the needs in later science
courses. The mentioned relearning of programming consumed much time
when they met a totally different language and totally different
applications of programming at the end of the bachelor studies.  We
therefore decided around 2006 to develop an introductory programming
course that could lay a firm foundation for continued programming in
all later courses that could benefit from integrating numerical
simulations. We would therefore teach programming in the context of
relevant algorithms like numerical integration, differentiation,
solution of differential equations, and Monte Carlo simulation.

The introductory programming course was scheduled for the very first
semester, meaning that the students would learn to program and use the
computer to solve mathematical problems from day one.  But what should
be the language of choice? MATLAB or C++ were obvious candidates
because of their popularity. These two languages are, however, very
different in nature, and it is not natural to integrate them in a course.
Python, on the other hand, can be used for MATLAB-style
programming and object-oriented or generative C++-style programming. In this
way Python provides a natural glue between different programming
styles.  We also knew that Python was much easier to use and teach
than C++.  The most convincing argument was, nevertheless, that Python
may act as a MATLAB replacement for students and professors, doing the
same things as MATLAB, and for free, but with a much more powerful
programming language at disposal.
#(Since I am on an 80% leave from
#the University, I am not qualified for MathWorks' academic discount,
#and my MATLAB license hence costs twice as much as my laptop.)

Again I wrote a "book":
"http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642183654/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340530481&sr=8-1&keywords=langtangen"
for the introductory programming course, this time addressing
newcomers to programming and concentrating the examples on numerical
computing. Needless to say, there were many skeptics: Python was of
marginal interest to scientific computing, Python was a bad first
language (because of its dynamic typing), mixing programming and
mathematics is inferior to first mastering calculus and Java
separately, etc. etc.

#People have constantly reminded me about the possibly marginal interest
#Python will obtain in science, and that going for the established, popular
#tools (MATLAB or C++) would be more relevant for the studentsa and also
#sell more books.

The "course":
"http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF1100/index-eng.xml" is
now a huge success, and the book is a best-seller in its
category. Since 2007, more than 1500 students have passed the exam and
used the programming technology to solve mathematical problems in
about 20 other courses in the Bachelor programs at the University of
Oslo. The introduction of programming and numerical simulation in all
these other courses was a huge undertaking known as the "Computing in
Science Education project":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/". This project
has attracted worldwide attention as it represents a long-awaited
reform of the science education.  The idea is trivial: let programming
and computer simulations change the curriculum! However, the
implementation among professors is extremely demanding most
places. The fortunate situation in Oslo is that professors across
disciplines have managed to collaborate on how programming and
simulation can be integrated in classical courses and used to replace
the classical strong attention on complicated and specialized
mathematical techniques for very simplified physical problems.
Recently, the Computing in Science Education project has been
acknowledged by the University and the government in Norway through
prestigious "awards":
"http://simula.no/news/computing-in-science-education-receives-learning-environment-award"
and generous funding.  The ideas are being implemented at other
Norwegian colleges and universities as well as at several institutions
abroad.

===== There is impact of teaching Python =====

The world is changed only when people do new things. When students
learn Python, they bring this knowledge to later courses and then to
industry. Their knowledge automatically creates a demand for using the
tools they prefer.  Many companies in the Oslo region that apply
Python today discovered the language through new employees who had
picked up Python in the scripting course. Similarly, students create
Python examples and projects in other courses and thereby attract
attention to the tool and its applications.

The science education at the University of Oslo puts much emphasis on
learning other languages, in particular MATLAB, R, C, C++, and
Fortran.  We teach (a subset of) Python in a way that eases the
transition to and from MATLAB.  For high performance we emphasize
reusing Fortran and C libraries from Python or migrating slow Python
code to compiled languages.  Our experience shows that users who gain
a good knowledge of Python tend to prefer that language and do as much
as possible in Python before the quest for high performance demands
using compiled languages.  It seems that many students and professors,
when their knowledge of Python is at the level of their MATLAB skills,
steadily drift to do most of their work in Python. The numerical
functionality in Python is not superior to MATLAB, so this drift is
more rooted in Python's clear syntax, powerful software engineering
tools, easy integration with Fortran and C/C++,
and rich set of libraries for non-numerical tasks.

The described trend among students and professors are also found in
industry: Python steadily eats of the MATLAB market because people find
the language stronger and more convenient. Our efforts in teaching and
professional use of Python contribute to the observed exponential
growth.

===== We let the students play with advanced problems =====

As mentioned, we start with numerics and programming when the 19-year
old new students arrive at the University. About 300 students enter
courses on classical calculus, numerical calculus, and programming of
the latter. The programming course covers basic MATLAB-style
procedural programming in the first half of the fall semester, while
the second half is spent on statistical simulations, ordinary
differential equations, and class programming (recall that classes and
object-oriented programming were invented in Oslo so we have no other
choice!). The final project is to create a flexible, object-oriented
toolbox for studying nonlinear vibration problems described by the
standard model

!bt
\[ m \ddot x + f(\dot x) + s(x) = F(t) \]
!et
The development environment for programming consists of the well-proven
terminal window and a text editor (`gedit`, `emacs`, or `vi`).

Many reviews of the "course book":
"http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642183654/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340530481&sr=8-1&keywords=langtangen"
claim that the book is quite advanced and may fit the graduate
level. However, most of the book is in fact covered the very first
semester in Oslo. This works well and the course has received
excellent student critiques.  Scientists usually think of Monte Carlo
simulation and nonlinear differential equations as advanced topics,
not belonging to first semester courses, but the methods and their
applications can be exposed in very intuitive ways suitable for
newbies.  At least the students can train their programming skills on
such problems and be able to produce solutions to what many
traditionally think of as advanced problems.  A deeper understanding
of what they actually do needs to wait until they master a broader set
of courses. My main message is that what is basic and what is advanced
should be continuously up for discussion.

===== We use Ubuntu to minimize installation problems =====

Many fear to introduce programming and simulation in courses because
there are so many technical details. For example, how shall students
install Python and 30 software packages on their personal
laptops? This question quickly scares teachers.
We have found a solution that has proven to be successful over the last
four years: *force all students to use Ubuntu*, and provide support for
Ubuntu only!

Mac users typically run Ubuntu in a virtual machine ("VirtualBox":
"http://www.virtualbox.org/", or preferably, "VMWare Player":
"http://www.vmware.com/products/player" or "VMWare Fusion":
"http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html/"), while Windows
users can run a virtual machine or have a dual boot.  The "Wubi":
"http://wubi-installer.org" software makes installing the dual boot
solution very easy.  On Ubuntu we have one package (`python-scitools`)
that installs everything the students need in one command. Later courses can
just provide a one-line command with their needs for additional packages.

There are several reasons why we dare to force the use of only one
operating system:

 o Installation of programming tools and mathematical software on Windows and Mac OS X requires comprehensive competence that very few students have and want to gain.
 o On Debian Linux systems, including Ubuntu, installation of complex mathematical software is done by a one-line command.
 o Debian Linux has the largest collection of mathematical software today.
 o When the students need to compile and link their own software, this seems to be easier on Linux systems than on Mac OS X and Windows. Although Mac OS X is basically Unix, there are many technical peculiarities that quickly calls for competence beyond what students and the average teacher have.
 o Ubuntu's graphical interface is very similar to Windows or Mac OS X so students pick up Ubuntu without any noise.
 o Students struggle much more with the logic of programming than with
   Emacs and Unix commands.

I should add that "Fedora Scientific": "http://www.floss4science.com/fedora-scientific-amit-saha/" may provide a viable alternative to Ubuntu, especially on sites where Fedora is already the supported Linux system. Fedora Scientific
now offers a lot of very useful "mathematics software":
"http://spins.fedoraproject.org/scientific-kde/"

In future cloud supercomputing I imagine one can just upload the Linux
image (running in a virtual machine) to the cloud service and avoid
tedious installation processes. By archiving the image along with
scientific results, one can at any time rerun simulations - the
complete operating system, all the needed software, and all data
reside in the image. This is key to reproducible science.

So far, I have not heard one single negative comment that we support
only one operating system.  When we tried to support Unix, Linux,
Windows, and Mac, there were a lot of complaints from students that
they did not have access to the right software and that technical
problems with computers stole too much attention. These complaints
have simply disappeared with the standardization on Ubuntu. So we have
learned that giving people more choices does not necessarily make them
happier.

__A final comment.__
The use of Ubuntu is mainly motivated by the total need of mathematical
packages and programming tools during a student's
entire stay at the university. If the need is basically an environment for doing
Python programming, the "Enthought Python Distribution": "http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php" or the "Python(x,y)": "http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/" package provide user-friendly environments on any standard Windows computer.
