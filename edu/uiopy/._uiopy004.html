<h2>We let the students play with advanced problems  <a name="___sec3"></a></h2>

As mentioned, we start with numerics and programming when the 19-year
old new students arrive at the University. About 300 students enter
courses on classical calculus, numerical calculus, and programming of
the latter. The programming course covers basic MATLAB-style
procedural programming in the first half of the fall semester, while
the second half is spent on statistical simulations, ordinary
differential equations, and class programming (recall that classes and
object-oriented programming were invented in Oslo so we have no other
choice!). The final project is to create a flexible, object-oriented
toolbox for studying nonlinear vibration problems described by the
standard model

$$ m \ddot x + f(\dot x) + s(x) = F(t) $$

The development environment for programming consists of the well-proven
terminal window and a text editor (<code>gedit</code>, <code>emacs</code>, or <code>vi</code>).

<p>
Many reviews of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642183654/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340530481&sr=8-1&keywords=langtangen" target="_self">course book</a>
claim that the book is quite advanced and may fit the graduate
level. However, most of the book is in fact covered the very first
semester in Oslo. This works well and the course has received
excellent student critiques.  Scientists usually think of Monte Carlo
simulation and nonlinear differential equations as advanced topics,
not belonging to first semester courses, but the methods and their
applications can be exposed in very intuitive ways suitable for
newbies.  At least the students can train their programming skills on
such problems and be able to produce solutions to what many
traditionally think of as advanced problems.  A deeper understanding
of what they actually do needs to wait until they master a broader set
of courses. My main message is that what is basic and what is advanced
should be continuously up for discussion.
